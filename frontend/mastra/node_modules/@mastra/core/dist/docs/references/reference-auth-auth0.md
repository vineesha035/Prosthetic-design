# MastraAuthAuth0 class

The `MastraAuthAuth0` class provides authentication for Mastra using Auth0. It verifies incoming requests using Auth0-issued JWT tokens and integrates with the Mastra server using the `auth` option.

## Usage example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { MastraAuthAuth0 } from '@mastra/auth-auth0'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    auth: new MastraAuthAuth0({
      domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN,
      audience: process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
    }),
  },
})
```

> **Note:** You can omit the constructor parameters if the required environment variables (`AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`) are set. In that case, use `new MastraAuthAuth0()` without any arguments.

## Constructor parameters

**domain** (`string`): Your Auth0 domain (e.g., your-tenant.auth0.com). This is used to verify JWT tokens issued by your Auth0 tenant. (Default: `process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN`)

**audience** (`string`): Your Auth0 API identifier/audience. This ensures tokens are intended for your specific API. (Default: `process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE`)

**name** (`string`): Custom name for the auth provider instance. (Default: `"auth0"`)

**authorizeUser** (`(user: Auth0User) => Promise<boolean> | boolean`): Custom authorization function to determine if a user should be granted access. Called after token verification. By default, allows all authenticated users with valid tokens.

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are automatically used when constructor options aren't provided:

**AUTH0\_DOMAIN** (`string`): Your Auth0 domain. Can be found in your Auth0 Dashboard under Applications > Settings.

**AUTH0\_AUDIENCE** (`string`): Your Auth0 API identifier. This is the identifier you set when creating an API in your Auth0 Dashboard.

## Default authorization behavior

By default, `MastraAuthAuth0` validates Auth0 JWT tokens and allows access to all authenticated users:

1. **Token Verification**: The JWT token is verified using Auth0's public keys (JWKS)
2. **Signature Validation**: Ensures the token was signed by your Auth0 tenant
3. **Expiration Check**: Verifies the token hasn't expired
4. **Audience Validation**: Confirms the token was issued for your specific API (audience)
5. **Issuer Validation**: Ensures the token was issued by your Auth0 domain

If all validations pass, the user is considered authorized. To implement custom authorization logic (e.g., role-based access control), provide a custom `authorizeUser` function.

## Auth0 user type

The `Auth0User` type used in the `authorizeUser` function corresponds to the decoded JWT token payload, which typically includes:

- `sub`: The user's unique identifier (subject)
- `email`: The user's email address (if included in token)
- `email_verified`: Whether the email is verified
- `name`: The user's display name (if available)
- `picture`: URL to the user's profile picture (if available)
- `iss`: Token issuer (your Auth0 domain)
- `aud`: Token audience (your API identifier)
- `iat`: Token issued at timestamp
- `exp`: Token expiration timestamp
- `scope`: Granted scopes for the token
- Custom claims and app metadata configured in your Auth0 tenant

The exact properties available depend on your Auth0 configuration, scopes requested, and any custom claims you've configured.
