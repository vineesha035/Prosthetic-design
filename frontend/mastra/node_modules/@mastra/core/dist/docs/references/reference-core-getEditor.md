const mastra = new Mastra({
  editor: new MastraEditor(),
})

const editor = mastra.getEditor()

const agent = await editor?.agent.create({
  id: 'support-agent',
  name: 'Support Agent',
  instructions: 'Help customers with their questions.',
})
```

## Parameters

This method doesn't accept any parameters.
