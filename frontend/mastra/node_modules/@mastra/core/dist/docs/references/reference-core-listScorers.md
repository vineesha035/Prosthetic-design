// Get all registered scorers
const allScorers = mastra.listScorers()

// Access a specific scorer
const myScorer = allScorers.relevancyScorer
```

## Parameters

This method takes no parameters.

## Returns

**scorers** (`Record<string, MastraScorer> | undefined`): An object containing all registered scorers, where keys are scorer names and values are MastraScorer instances. Returns undefined if no scorers are registered.
