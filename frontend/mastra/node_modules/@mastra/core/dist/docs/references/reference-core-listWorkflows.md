# Mastra.listWorkflows()

The `.listWorkflows()` method is used to retrieve all workflows that have been configured in the Mastra instance. The method accepts an optional options object.

## Usage example

```typescript
mastra.listWorkflows()
```

## Parameters

**options** (`{ serialized?: boolean }`): Optional configuration object. When serialized is true, returns simplified workflow objects with only the name property instead of full workflow instances.

## Returns

**workflows** (`Record<string, Workflow>`): A record of all configured workflows, where keys are workflow IDs and values are workflow instances (or simplified objects if serialized is true).
