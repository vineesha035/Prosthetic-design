# dataset.startExperimentAsync()

**Added in:** `@mastra/core@1.4.0`

Starts an experiment asynchronously (fire-and-forget). Returns immediately with the experiment ID and a `'pending'` status. The experiment runs in the background.

## Usage example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'

const mastra = new Mastra({/* storage config */})

const dataset = await mastra.datasets.get({ id: 'dataset-id' })

// Start experiment without waiting
const { experimentId, status } = await dataset.startExperimentAsync({
  targetType: 'agent',
  targetId: 'my-agent',
  scorers: ['accuracy'],
})

console.log(`Experiment ${experimentId} started with status: ${status}`)

// Check progress later
const experiment = await dataset.getExperiment({ experimentId })
console.log(`Current status: ${experiment.status}`)
```

## Parameters

Takes the same `StartExperimentConfig` as [`dataset.startExperiment()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/datasets/startExperiment).

When `persistence.experiments` is set to `'none'`, `startExperimentAsync()` doesn't persist an experiment record, progress updates, or item results. Score persistence remains controlled separately by `persistence.scores`. Without an experiment event observer, the run is fire-and-forget, and the experiment API can't report whether it completed or failed.

Use synchronous [`startExperiment()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/datasets/startExperiment) when the caller needs the returned summary. An experiment event observer can receive lifecycle events and the terminal summary.

## Returns

**result** (`Promise<object>`): Immediate response with experiment ID.

**result.experimentId** (`string`): Unique ID of the created experiment.

**result.status** (`'pending'`): Always 'pending' since the experiment hasn't started executing yet.
