# Completeness scorer

The `createCompletenessScorer()` function evaluates how thoroughly an LLM's output covers the key elements present in the input. It analyzes nouns, verbs, topics, and terms to determine coverage and provides a detailed completeness score.

## Parameters

The `createCompletenessScorer()` function doesn't take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/evals/mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## `.run()` returns

**runId** (`string`): The id of the run (optional).

**preprocessStepResult** (`object`): Object with extracted elements and coverage details: { inputElements: string\[], outputElements: string\[], missingElements: string\[], elementCounts: { input: number, output: number } }

**score** (`number`): Completeness score (0-1) representing the proportion of input elements covered in the output.

The `.run()` method returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  runId: string,
  extractStepResult: {
    inputElements: string[],
    outputElements: string[],
    missingElements: string[],
    elementCounts: { input: number, output: number }
  },
  score: number
}
```

## Element extraction details

The scorer extracts and analyzes several types of elements:

- Nouns: Key objects, concepts, and entities
- Verbs: Actions and states (converted to infinitive form)
- Topics: Main subjects and themes
- Terms: Individual substantial words

The extraction process includes:

- Normalization of text (removing diacritics, converting to lowercase)
- Splitting camelCase words
- Handling of word boundaries
- Special handling of short words (3 characters or less)
- Deduplication of elements

### `extractStepResult`

From the `.run()` method, you can get the `extractStepResult` object with the following properties:

- **inputElements**: Key elements found in the input (e.g., nouns, verbs, topics, terms).
- **outputElements**: Key elements found in the output.
- **missingElements**: Input elements not found in the output.
- **elementCounts**: The number of elements in the input and output.

## Scoring details

The scorer evaluates completeness through linguistic element coverage analysis.

### Scoring Process

1. Extracts key elements:

   - Nouns and named entities
   - Action verbs
   - Topic-specific terms
   - Normalized word forms

2. Calculates coverage of input elements:

   - Exact matches for short terms (≤3 chars)
   - Substantial overlap (>60%) for longer terms

Final score: `(covered_elements / total_input_elements) * scale`

### Score interpretation

A completeness score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Thoroughly addresses all aspects of the query with detailed detail.
- **0.7 to 0.9**: Covers most important aspects with good detail, minor gaps.
- **0.4 to 0.6**: Addresses some key points but missing important aspects or lacking detail.
- **0.1 to 0.3**: Only partially addresses the query with substantial gaps.
- **0.0**: Fails to address the query or provides irrelevant information.

## Example

Evaluate agent responses for completeness across different query complexities:

```typescript
import { runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'
import { createCompletenessScorer } from '@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt'
import { myAgent } from './agent'

const scorer = createCompletenessScorer()

const result = await runEvals({
  data: [
    {
      input:
        'Explain the process of photosynthesis, including the inputs, outputs, and stages involved.',
    },
    {
      input: 'What are the benefits and drawbacks of remote work for both employees and employers?',
    },
    {
      input:
        'Compare renewable and non-renewable energy sources in terms of cost, environmental impact, and sustainability.',
    },
  ],
  scorers: [scorer],
  target: myAgent,
  onItemComplete: ({ scorerResults }) => {
    console.log({
      score: scorerResults[scorer.id].score,
    })
  },
})

console.log(result.scores)
```
