# Content similarity scorer

The `createContentSimilarityScorer()` function measures the textual similarity between two strings, providing a score that indicates how closely they match. It supports configurable options for case sensitivity and whitespace handling.

## Parameters

The `createContentSimilarityScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

**ignoreCase** (`boolean`): Whether to ignore case differences when comparing strings. (Default: `true`)

**ignoreWhitespace** (`boolean`): Whether to normalize whitespace when comparing strings. (Default: `true`)

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/evals/mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## `.run()` returns

**runId** (`string`): The id of the run (optional).

**preprocessStepResult** (`object`): Object with processed input and output: { processedInput: string, processedOutput: string }

**analyzeStepResult** (`object`): Object with similarity: { similarity: number }

**score** (`number`): Similarity score (0-1) where 1 indicates perfect similarity.

## Scoring details

The scorer evaluates textual similarity through character-level matching and configurable text normalization.

### Scoring Process

1. Normalizes text:

   - Case normalization (if ignoreCase: true)
   - Whitespace normalization (if ignoreWhitespace: true)

2. Compares processed strings using string-similarity algorithm:

   - Analyzes character sequences
   - Aligns word boundaries
   - Considers relative positions
   - Accounts for length differences

Final score: `similarity_value * scale`

## Example

Evaluate textual similarity between expected and actual agent outputs:

```typescript
import { runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'
import { createContentSimilarityScorer } from '@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt'
import { myAgent } from './agent'

const scorer = createContentSimilarityScorer()

const result = await runEvals({
  data: [
    {
      input: 'Summarize the benefits of TypeScript',
      groundTruth:
        'TypeScript provides static typing, better tooling support, and improved code maintainability.',
    },
    {
      input: 'What is machine learning?',
      groundTruth:
        'Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.',
    },
  ],
  scorers: [scorer],
  target: myAgent,
  onItemComplete: ({ scorerResults }) => {
    console.log({
      score: scorerResults[scorer.id].score,
      groundTruth: scorerResults[scorer.id].groundTruth,
    })
  },
})

console.log(result.scores)
```

To add this scorer to an agent, see the [Scorers overview](https://mastra.ai/docs/evals/overview) guide.

### Score interpretation

A similarity score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Perfect match, content is nearly identical.
- **0.7 to 0.9**: High similarity, minor differences in word choice or structure.
- **0.4 to 0.6**: Moderate similarity, general overlap with noticeable variation.
- **0.1 to 0.3**: Low similarity, few common elements or shared meaning.
- **0.0**: No similarity, completely different content.
