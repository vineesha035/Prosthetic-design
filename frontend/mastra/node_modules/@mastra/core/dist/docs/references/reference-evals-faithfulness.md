# Faithfulness scorer

The `createFaithfulnessScorer()` function evaluates how factually accurate an LLM's output is compared to the provided context. It extracts claims from the output and verifies them against the context, making it essential to measure RAG pipeline responses' reliability.

## Parameters

The `createFaithfulnessScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

**model** (`LanguageModel`): Configuration for the model used to evaluate faithfulness.

**context** (`string[]`): Array of context chunks against which the output's claims will be verified.

**scale** (`number`): The maximum score value. The final score will be normalized to this scale. (Default: `1`)

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. The `.run()` method accepts the same input as other scorers (see the [MastraScorer reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/evals/mastra-scorer)), but the return value includes LLM-specific fields as documented below.

## `.run()` returns

**runId** (`string`): The id of the run (optional).

**preprocessStepResult** (`string[]`): Array of extracted claims from the output.

**preprocessPrompt** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the preprocess step (optional).

**analyzeStepResult** (`object`): Object with verdicts: { verdicts: Array<{ verdict: 'yes' | 'no' | 'unsure', reason: string }> }

**analyzePrompt** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the analyze step (optional).

**score** (`number`): A score between 0 and the configured scale, representing the proportion of claims that are supported by the context.

**reason** (`string`): A detailed explanation of the score, including which claims were supported, contradicted, or marked as unsure.

**generateReasonPrompt** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the generateReason step (optional).

## Scoring details

The scorer evaluates faithfulness through claim verification against provided context.

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes claims and context:

   - Extracts all claims (factual and speculative)

   - Verifies each claim against context

   - Assigns one of three verdicts:

     - "yes" - claim supported by context
     - "no" - claim contradicts context
     - "unsure" - claim unverifiable

2. Calculates faithfulness score:

   - Counts supported claims
   - Divides by total claims
   - Scales to configured range

Final score: `(supported_claims / total_claims) * scale`

### Score interpretation

A faithfulness score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: All claims are accurate and directly supported by the context.
- **0.7 to 0.9**: Most claims are correct, with minor additions or omissions.
- **0.4 to 0.6**: Some claims are supported, but others are unverifiable.
- **0.1 to 0.3**: Most of the content is inaccurate or unsupported.
- **0.0**: All claims are false or contradict the context.

## Example

Evaluate agent responses for faithfulness to provided context:

```typescript
import { runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'
import { createFaithfulnessScorer } from '@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt'
import { myAgent } from './agent'

// Context is typically populated from agent tool calls or RAG retrieval
const scorer = createFaithfulnessScorer({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
})

const result = await runEvals({
  data: [
    {
      input: 'Tell me about the Tesla Model 3.',
    },
    {
      input: 'What are the key features of this electric vehicle?',
    },
  ],
  scorers: [scorer],
  target: myAgent,
  onItemComplete: ({ scorerResults }) => {
    console.log({
      score: scorerResults[scorer.id].score,
      reason: scorerResults[scorer.id].reason,
    })
  },
})

console.log(result.scores)
```
