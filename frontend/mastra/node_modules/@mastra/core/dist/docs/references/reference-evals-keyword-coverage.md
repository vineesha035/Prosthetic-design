# Keyword coverage scorer

The `createKeywordCoverageScorer()` function evaluates how well an LLM's output covers the important keywords from the input. It analyzes keyword presence and matches while ignoring common words and stop words.

## Parameters

The `createKeywordCoverageScorer()` function doesn't take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/evals/mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## `.run()` returns

**runId** (`string`): The id of the run (optional).

**preprocessStepResult** (`object`): Object with extracted keywords: { referenceKeywords: Set\<string>, responseKeywords: Set\<string> }

**analyzeStepResult** (`object`): Object with keyword coverage: { totalKeywords: number, matchedKeywords: number }

**score** (`number`): Coverage score (0-1) representing the proportion of matched keywords.

`.run()` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  runId: string,
  extractStepResult: {
    referenceKeywords: Set<string>,
    responseKeywords: Set<string>
  },
  analyzeStepResult: {
    totalKeywords: number,
    matchedKeywords: number
  },
  score: number
}
```

## Scoring details

The scorer evaluates keyword coverage by matching keywords with the following features:

- Common word and stop word filtering (e.g., "the", "a", "and")
- Case-insensitive matching
- Word form variation handling
- Special handling of technical terms and compound words

### Scoring Process

1. Processes keywords from input and output:

   - Filters out common words and stop words
   - Normalizes case and word forms
   - Handles special terms and compounds

2. Calculates keyword coverage:

   - Matches keywords between texts
   - Counts successful matches
   - Computes coverage ratio

Final score: `(matched_keywords / total_keywords) * scale`

### Score interpretation

A coverage score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Complete coverage, all keywords present.
- **0.7 to 0.9**: High coverage, most keywords included.
- **0.4 to 0.6**: Partial coverage, some keywords present.
- **0.1 to 0.3**: Low coverage, few keywords matched.
- **0.0**: The response contains none of the keywords.

### Special Cases

The scorer handles several special cases:

- Empty input/output: Returns score of 1.0 if both empty, 0.0 if only one is empty
- Single word: Treated as a single keyword
- Technical terms: Preserves compound technical terms (e.g., "React.js", "machine learning")
- Case differences: "JavaScript" matches "javascript"
- Common words: Ignored in scoring to focus on useful keywords

## Example

Evaluate keyword coverage between input queries and agent responses:

```typescript
import { runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals'
import { createKeywordCoverageScorer } from '@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt'
import { myAgent } from './agent'

const scorer = createKeywordCoverageScorer()

const result = await runEvals({
  data: [
    {
      input: 'JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue',
    },
    {
      input: 'TypeScript offers interfaces, generics, and type inference',
    },
    {
      input:
        'Machine learning models require data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning',
    },
  ],
  scorers: [scorer],
  target: myAgent,
  onItemComplete: ({ scorerResults }) => {
    console.log({
      score: scorerResults[scorer.id].score,
    })
  },
})

console.log(result.scores)
```
