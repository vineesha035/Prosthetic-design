# Studio

Mastra configures [Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/overview) from a `studio.ts` file directly under `src/mastra/`. The file default-exports a `StudioConfig` object for Studio authentication and authorization: who can access Studio, and what authenticated users can do.

Use this page for the file-based convention. For auth providers, role-based access control (RBAC), and fine-grained authorization (FGA), see [Studio auth](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/auth).

## Quickstart

For local development, you don't need `studio.ts`. Start the dev server and open Studio:

**npm**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**pnpm**:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

**Yarn**:

```bash
yarn dev
```

**Bun**:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Studio opens without authentication in local development. Add `studio.ts` when you're ready to secure a shared or production deployment.

## Add authentication

Use an auth provider to require sign-in before users can access Studio. This example uses [WorkOS](https://mastra.ai/docs/server/auth/workos):

```typescript
import { MastraAuthWorkos } from '@mastra/auth-workos'
import type { StudioConfig } from '@mastra/core/server'

export default {
  auth: new MastraAuthWorkos(),
} satisfies StudioConfig
```

The auth provider handles who the user is. For what the user can do after sign-in, add RBAC or FGA in the same config. See [Studio auth](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/auth) for full examples.

## Precedence with code

Code-registered Studio config wins over `studio.ts`. Use `studio.ts` when one project-wide Studio config is enough. Use code registration when auth depends on runtime wiring in `src/mastra/index.ts`.
