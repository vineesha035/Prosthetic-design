# Observational Memory

**Added in:** `@mastra/memory@1.1.0`

Observational Memory (OM) is Mastra's memory system for long-context agentic memory. An **Observer** watches conversations and creates observations. A **Reflector** restructures those observations by combining related items and condensing overarching patterns. Together, they maintain an observation log that replaces raw message history as it grows.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: true,
    },
  }),
})
```

## Configuration

The `observationalMemory` option accepts `true`, a configuration object, or `false`. Setting `true` enables OM with `google/gemini-2.5-flash` as the default model. When passing a config object, set `model` at the top level or on `observation.model` and/or `reflection.model`; when all model fields are omitted, OM falls back to `google/gemini-2.5-flash`.

Observer input is multimodal-aware. OM keeps text placeholders like `[Image #1: screenshot.png]` in the transcript it builds for the Observer, and also sends the underlying image parts when possible. This applies to both single-thread observation and batched multi-thread observation. Non-image files appear as placeholders only.

OM performs thresholding with fast local token estimation. Text uses `tokenx`, and image-like inputs use provider-aware heuristics plus deterministic fallbacks when metadata is incomplete.

**enabled** (`boolean`): Enable or disable Observational Memory. When omitted from a config object, defaults to true. Only enabled: false explicitly disables it. (Default: `true`)

**model** (`string | LanguageModel | DynamicModel | ModelByInputTokens | ModelWithRetries[]`): Model for both the Observer and Reflector agents. Sets the model for both at once. Cannot be used together with observation.model or reflection.model — an error will be thrown if both are set. When this and observation.model/reflection.model are all omitted, OM falls back to google/gemini-2.5-flash. Use "default" to explicitly use the default model (google/gemini-2.5-flash). (Default: `'google/gemini-2.5-flash'`)

**scope** (`'resource' | 'thread'`): Memory scope for observations. 'thread' keeps observations per-thread. 'resource' (experimental) shares observations across all threads for a resource, enabling cross-conversation memory. (Default: `'thread'`)

**activateAfterIdle** (`number | string | false | "auto"`): Time before buffered observations are forced to activate after inactivity, even before observation.messageTokens is reached. Accepts a numeric millisecond value such as 300\_000, duration strings like "5m" or "1hr", "auto" for a provider-aware prompt cache TTL, or false to disable inherited observation idle activation. Reflections do not inherit this setting. Use reflection.activateAfterIdle to opt reflections into idle activation.

**activateOnProviderChange** (`boolean`): Force buffered observations to activate when the actor provider or model changes. Reflections do not inherit this setting. Use reflection.activateOnProviderChange to opt reflections into provider-change activation. (Default: `false`)

**shareTokenBudget** (`boolean`): Share the token budget between messages and observations. When enabled, the total budget is observation.messageTokens + reflection.observationTokens. Messages can use more space when observations are small, and vice versa. This maximizes context usage through flexible allocation. shareTokenBudget is not yet compatible with async buffering. You must set observation: { bufferTokens: false } when using this option (this is a temporary limitation). (Default: `false`)

**temporalMarkers** (`boolean`): Insert temporal-gap reminder markers before new user messages when the previous message in the thread is at least 10 minutes older. The marker is persisted in memory, emitted as an inline reminder event so clients can render it specially, and shown to the observer so it can anchor observations to when events occurred. (Default: `false`)

**retrieval** (`boolean | { vector?: boolean; scope?: 'thread' | 'resource'; instructions?: string }`): Let the agent look up the raw message history behind its observations. Observation groups keep durable pointers to the original messages, and a recall tool is registered so the agent can browse them. true enables cross-thread browsing by default. { vector: true } also enables semantic search using Memory's vector store and embedder. { scope: 'thread' } restricts the recall tool to the current thread only. Default scope is 'resource'. { instructions: '...' } appends application-specific recall guidance after Mastra's built-in retrieval instructions. (Default: `false`)

**hooks** (`ObserveHooks`): Lifecycle hooks fired for every observation/reflection cycle — the manual observe()/reflect() APIs, turn-driven synchronous observation, and fire-and-forget async buffering. Callbacks receive threadId/resourceId/trigger call context ('manual' | 'turn-sync' | 'async-buffer'), and the end hooks (onObservationEnd/onReflectionEnd) additionally receive the OM model call's token usage and providerMetadata (where providers such as the AI Gateway report per-call cost), so apps can account for OM model spend without wrapping the observer/reflector models in middleware. Failed async-buffered cycles never throw; they report through the end hook's error field. Errors thrown by these hooks are caught and logged — they never fail the cycle.

**observation** (`ObservationalMemoryObservationConfig`): Configuration for the observation step. Controls when the Observer agent runs and how it behaves.

**observation.model** (`string | LanguageModel | DynamicModel | ModelByInputTokens | ModelWithRetries[]`): Model for the Observer agent. Cannot be set if a top-level model is also provided. If neither this nor the top-level model is set, falls back to reflection.model.

**observation.instruction** (`string`): Custom instruction appended to the Observer's system prompt. Use this to customize what the Observer focuses on, such as domain-specific preferences or priorities.

**observation.threadTitle** (`boolean`): When true, the Observer suggests short thread titles and updates the thread title when the conversation topic meaningfully changes. This is opt-in and defaults to disabled.

**observation.extract** (`Extractor[]`): Custom values to extract after observation. Schema-less extractors are requested inline in the Observer output. Schema-backed extractors run as a follow-up structured output call and are stored in thread OM metadata.

**observation.manageWorkingMemory** (`boolean`): Let the Observer manage working memory through OM extraction. Adds WorkingMemoryExtractor, defaults workingMemory.agentManaged to false, and defaults workingMemory.useStateSignals to true. See Working memory updates.

**observation.observeAttachments** (`'auto' | boolean | string[]`): Controls which image/file attachments are forwarded to the Observer model alongside their placeholder text lines. true (default) forwards all attachments. false drops all attachments while keeping placeholders visible. 'auto' uses the provider capabilities registry to decide: attachments are forwarded when the Observer model supports multimodal input, dropped otherwise, and forwarded when no capability data is available for the model. An array is a case-insensitive mimeType allowlist supporting exact matches ('application/pdf'), wildcard subtypes ('image/\*'), and bare '\*' for everything. Useful when the Observer model is text-only (e.g. some DeepSeek endpoints) while the main agent uses a multimodal model. Tool-result attachments are filtered using the same rule.

**observation.messageTokens** (`number`): Token count of unobserved messages that triggers observation. When unobserved message tokens exceed this threshold, the Observer agent is called. Text is estimated locally with tokenx. Image parts are included with model-aware heuristics when possible, with deterministic fallbacks when image metadata is incomplete. Image-like file parts are counted the same way when uploads are normalized as files.

**observation.maxTokensPerBatch** (`number`): Maximum tokens per batch when observing multiple threads in resource scope. Threads are chunked into batches of this size and processed in parallel. Lower values mean more parallelism but more API calls.

**observation.modelSettings** (`ObservationalMemoryModelSettings`): Model settings for the Observer agent. The maxOutputTokens: 100\_000 default is only applied with default model selection (no model set, "default", or a ModelByInputTokens selector). Custom models get no maxOutputTokens default.

**observation.modelSettings.temperature** (`number`): Temperature for generation. Lower values produce more consistent output.

**observation.modelSettings.maxOutputTokens** (`number`): Maximum output tokens. Set high to prevent truncation of observations. The 100000 default is only applied with default model selection; custom models get no default.

**observation.providerOptions** (`ProviderOptions`): Provider-specific options passed to the Observer agent, such as Google thinking configuration.

**observation.bufferTokens** (`number | false`): How often background observation buffering runs. Values between 0 and 1 are fractions of messageTokens: 0.25 buffers every 25% of the threshold (7.5k tokens with the default 30k). Values of 1 or more are absolute token counts: 5000 buffers every 5k tokens. Buffered observations are stored until the messageTokens threshold is reached, then activate instantly without a blocking LLM call. Must resolve to less than messageTokens. Set to false to disable all async buffering (both observation and reflection).

**observation.bufferOnIdle** (`boolean`): Run background observation buffering when an agent turn ends and the agent becomes idle. This is separate from bufferTokens, which controls step-time async buffering. Set this to true to buffer short idle turns without waiting for the next turn or the messageTokens threshold.

**observation.bufferActivation** (`number`): How much of the message window to clear when buffered observations activate. Values between 0 and 1 are the fraction of messageTokens to remove: 0.8 removes \~80% of the message history and keeps \~20% (6k tokens with the default 30k). Values of 1000 or more are the token count to keep: 4000 keeps \~4k message tokens after activation. Note the direction flips: a higher ratio removes more history, while a higher token count keeps more.

**observation.activateAfterIdle** (`number | string | false | "auto"`): Time before buffered observations are forced to activate after inactivity. Accepts milliseconds, a duration string, "auto" for a provider-aware prompt cache TTL, or false. If unset, the top-level activateAfterIdle value is used for observations. Set false to disable the top-level idle setting for observations. Currently only applied when using the standalone ObservationalMemory class; new Memory(...) applies the top-level activateAfterIdle only.

**observation.activateOnProviderChange** (`boolean`): Force buffered observations to activate when the actor provider or model changes. If unset, the top-level activateOnProviderChange value is used for observations. Currently only applied when using the standalone ObservationalMemory class; new Memory(...) applies the top-level activateOnProviderChange only.

**observation.blockAfter** (`number`): Safety net that forces a synchronous (blocking) observation when background buffering can't keep up. Values from 1 up to (but not including) 100 are multipliers of messageTokens: 1.2 forces a blocking observation at 120% of the threshold (36k tokens with the default 30k). Values of 100 or more are absolute token counts and must be greater than messageTokens. Between messageTokens and blockAfter, only async buffering and activation run; buffered activation still preserves a minimum remaining context (the smaller of 1000 tokens or the retention floor). Only relevant when bufferTokens is set. Defaults to 1.2 when async buffering is enabled.

**observation.previousObserverTokens** (`number | false`): Optional token budget for the observer's previous-observations context. When set to a number, the observations passed to the Observer agent are tail-truncated to fit within this budget while keeping the newest observations and preserving highlighted 🔴 items when possible. When a buffered reflection is pending, the already-reflected observation lines are automatically replaced with the reflection summary before truncation. Set to 0 to omit previous observations entirely, or false to disable truncation explicitly.

**reflection** (`ObservationalMemoryReflectionConfig`): Configuration for the reflection step. Controls when the Reflector agent runs and how it behaves.

**reflection.model** (`string | LanguageModel | DynamicModel | ModelByInputTokens | ModelWithRetries[]`): Model for the Reflector agent. Cannot be set if a top-level model is also provided. If neither this nor the top-level model is set, falls back to observation.model.

**reflection.instruction** (`string`): Custom instruction appended to the Reflector's system prompt. Use this to customize how the Reflector consolidates observations, such as prioritizing certain types of information.

**reflection.extract** (`Extractor[]`): Custom values to extract after reflection. Schema-less extractors are requested inline in the Reflector output. Schema-backed extractors run as a follow-up structured output call and are stored in thread OM metadata.

**reflection.observationTokens** (`number`): Token count of observations that triggers reflection. When observation tokens exceed this threshold, the Reflector agent is called to condense them.

**reflection.modelSettings** (`ObservationalMemoryModelSettings`): Model settings for the Reflector agent. The maxOutputTokens: 100\_000 default is only applied with default model selection (no model set, "default", or a ModelByInputTokens selector). Custom models get no maxOutputTokens default.

**reflection.modelSettings.temperature** (`number`): Temperature for generation. Lower values produce more consistent output.

**reflection.modelSettings.maxOutputTokens** (`number`): Maximum output tokens. Set high to prevent truncation of observations. The 100000 default is only applied with default model selection; custom models get no default.

**reflection.providerOptions** (`ProviderOptions`): Provider-specific options passed to the Reflector agent, such as Google thinking configuration.

**reflection.bufferActivation** (`number`): When background reflection starts, as a ratio (0-1) of observationTokens: 0.5 starts reflecting in the background once observations reach 50% of the threshold (20k tokens with the default 40k). When the full threshold is reached, the buffered reflection replaces the observations it covers, preserving any new observations appended after that range.

**reflection.activateAfterIdle** (`number | string | false | "auto"`): Time before buffered reflections are forced to activate after inactivity. Accepts milliseconds, a duration string, "auto" for a provider-aware prompt cache TTL, or false. Reflections do not inherit top-level activateAfterIdle; set this explicitly to opt reflections into idle activation. Currently only applied when using the standalone ObservationalMemory class; this setting has no effect through new Memory(...).

**reflection.activateOnProviderChange** (`boolean`): Force buffered reflections to activate when the actor provider or model changes. Reflections do not inherit top-level activateOnProviderChange; set this explicitly to opt reflections into provider-change activation. Currently only applied when using the standalone ObservationalMemory class; this setting has no effect through new Memory(...).

**reflection.blockAfter** (`number`): Safety net that forces a synchronous (blocking) reflection when background reflection can't keep up. Values from 1 up to (but not including) 100 are multipliers of observationTokens: 1.2 forces a blocking reflection at 120% of the threshold (48k tokens with the default 40k). Values of 100 or more are absolute token counts and must be greater than observationTokens. Between observationTokens and blockAfter, only async buffering and activation run. Only relevant when bufferActivation is set. Defaults to 1.2 when async reflection is enabled.

### Token estimate metadata cache

OM persists token payload estimates so repeated counting can reuse prior token estimation work.

- Part-level cache: `part.providerMetadata.mastra`.
- String-content fallback cache: message-level metadata when no parts exist.
- Cache entries are ignored and recomputed if cache version/tokenizer source doesn't match.
- Per-message and per-conversation overhead are always recomputed at runtime and aren't cached.
- `data-*` and `reasoning` parts are skipped and don't receive cache entries.

## Extractor API

`Extractor` defines a value that OM should extract during observation or reflection. Built-in OM values such as `current-task`, `suggested-response`, and `thread-title` use the same extractor pipeline as custom values.

```typescript
import { Memory, Extractor } from '@mastra/memory'
import { z } from 'zod'

const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    observationalMemory: {
      model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
      observation: {
        extract: [
          new Extractor({
            name: 'User profile',
            instructions: 'Extract stable user profile facts that should be remembered.',
            schema: z.object({
              name: z.string().optional(),
              timezone: z.string().optional(),
            }),
          }),
        ],
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**name** (`string`): Human-readable extractor name. OM slugifies this value into the extractor slug. Names must be unique after slug generation.

**slug** (`string`): Read-only property derived from name — not a constructor option. Generated stable identifier for persisted values and XML tags. Slugs use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Built-in slugs and reserved XML tags cannot be used by custom extractors.

**instructions** (`string | (context) => string`): Instructions for what to extract and when to update the value. Use a function to derive instructions from runtime context.

**schema** (`ZodType<T> | (context) => ZodType<T> | undefined`): Optional Zod schema for structured extraction. When provided, OM runs a follow-up structured output call after the main OM operation. When omitted, the extractor is an inline string extractor emitted in the Observer or Reflector response. Use a function to derive the schema from runtime context.

**includePreviousExtraction** (`boolean`): Controls whether the previous extraction is shown to the extractor on future OM runs. Set to false for values that should only come from the current OM run. (Default: `true`)

**metadataKeyPath** (`string | false`): Dot-separated OM metadata path used to persist the extracted value. Set to false to skip OM metadata persistence entirely. (Default: `'extracted.<slug>'`)

**onExtracted** (`(context) => T | void | Promise<T | void>`): Optional hook called after a custom extractor returns a value and before metadata is persisted. Returning a value replaces the extracted value. Throwing records an extraction failure.

### Extraction behavior

- Extracted values are stored in thread OM metadata under `om.extracted`.
- Built-in extractor values are also mirrored to the compatibility metadata fields `currentTask`, `suggestedResponse`, and `threadTitle`.
- `thread-title` updates the thread title only when `observation.threadTitle` is enabled.
- `observation.extract` runs during observation. `reflection.extract` runs during reflection.
- Schema-backed extractors add a follow-up structured output request.
- Schema-less extractors are inline string extractors emitted directly in the Observer or Reflector output.
- Dynamic extractor functions receive runtime context, including `source`, `threadId`, `resourceId`, `mainAgent`, `memory`, and `requestContext` when available.
- `WorkingMemoryExtractor` uses the normal extractor pipeline to update working memory through the active `Memory` instance. It uses structured extraction when working memory has a JSON schema and skips OM metadata persistence, so the working memory payload isn't duplicated under OM extracted metadata.
- `observationalMemory.observation.manageWorkingMemory` adds `WorkingMemoryExtractor` and defaults `workingMemory.agentManaged` to `false`. It defaults `workingMemory.useStateSignals` to `true` when working memory is enabled.
- Extraction failures are reported in OM marker data and don't discard other successful extracted values.

## Examples

### Working memory updates

Use `observationalMemory.observation.manageWorkingMemory` when OM should update working memory.

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'

const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
    },
    observationalMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      observation: {
        manageWorkingMemory: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Set `workingMemory.agentManaged: true` if the main agent should still receive working memory tool and instruction injection.

### Resource scope with custom thresholds (experimental)

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
        scope: 'resource',
        observation: {
          messageTokens: 20_000,
        },
        reflection: {
          observationTokens: 60_000,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Shared token budget

When `shareTokenBudget` is enabled, the total budget is `observation.messageTokens + reflection.observationTokens` (100k in this example). If observations only use 30k tokens, messages can expand to use up to 70k. If messages are short, observations have more room before triggering reflection.

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        shareTokenBudget: true,
        observation: {
          messageTokens: 20_000,
          bufferTokens: false, // required when using shareTokenBudget (temporary limitation)
        },
        reflection: {
          observationTokens: 80_000,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Custom model

By passing a `model` in the config, you can use any model from Mastra's model router.

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Different models per agent

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        observation: {
          model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
        },
        reflection: {
          model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Custom instructions

Customize what the Observer and Reflector focus on by providing custom instructions:

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'health-assistant',
  name: 'health-assistant',
  instructions: 'You are a health and wellness assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
        observation: {
          // Focus observations on health-related preferences and goals
          instruction:
            'Prioritize capturing user health goals, dietary restrictions, exercise preferences, and medical considerations. Avoid capturing general chit-chat.',
        },
        reflection: {
          // Guide reflection to consolidate health patterns
          instruction:
            'When consolidating, group related health information together. Preserve specific metrics, dates, and medical details.',
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Async buffering

Async buffering is **enabled by default**. It pre-computes observations in the background as the conversation grows: when the `messageTokens` threshold is reached, buffered observations activate instantly with no blocking LLM call.

The lifecycle follows **buffer → activate → remove messages → repeat**. Background Observer calls run at `bufferTokens` intervals, each producing a chunk of observations. At threshold, chunks activate: observations move into the log, raw messages are removed from context. The `blockAfter` threshold forces a synchronous fallback if buffering can't keep up.

Default settings:

- `observation.bufferTokens: 0.2`: Buffer every 20% of `messageTokens` (e.g. every \~6k tokens with a 30k threshold)
- `observation.bufferActivation: 0.8`: On activation, remove enough messages to keep only 20% of the threshold remaining
- Buffered observations include continuation hints (`suggestedResponse`, `currentTask`) that survive activation to maintain conversational continuity
- `reflection.bufferActivation: 0.5`: start background reflection at 50% of observation threshold

To customize:

```typescript
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
        observation: {
          messageTokens: 30_000,
          // Buffer every 5k tokens (runs in background)
          bufferTokens: 5_000,
          // Activate to retain 30% of threshold
          bufferActivation: 0.7,
          // Force synchronous observation at 1.5x threshold
          blockAfter: 1.5,
        },
        reflection: {
          observationTokens: 60_000,
          // Start background reflection at 50% of threshold
          bufferActivation: 0.5,
          // Force synchronous reflection at 1.2x threshold
          blockAfter: 1.2,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

To disable async buffering entirely:

```typescript
observationalMemory: {
  model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
  observation: {
    bufferTokens: false,
  },
}
```

Setting `bufferTokens: false` disables both observation and reflection async buffering. Observations and reflections will run synchronously when their thresholds are reached.

> **Note:** Async buffering isn't supported with `scope: 'resource'` and is automatically disabled in resource scope.

## Streaming data parts

Observational Memory emits typed data parts during agent execution that clients can use for real-time UI feedback. These are streamed alongside the agent's response.

### Read extractor results

Both completion events carry extractor output in their `data` payload. The extractor fields are:

```typescript
interface DataOmObservationEndPart {
  type: 'data-om-observation-end'
  data: {
    /** Whether the completed work was an observation or reflection */
    operationType: 'observation' | 'reflection'
    /** Values extracted during this OM operation, keyed by extractor slug */
    extractedValues?: Record<string, unknown>
    /** Extractor failures from this OM operation. Successful extractor values are still included */
    extractionFailures?: Array<{ slug: string; error: string }>
    // ...other fields documented in the tables below
  }
}
```

Both extractor fields are optional. A completion can include values, failures, both, or neither. `data-om-observation-end` reports synchronous completion. `data-om-buffering-end` reports completed background work whose buffered content still awaits activation, although extractor metadata is already persisted. `DataOmBufferingEndPart` carries the same extractor fields, and both types are exported from `@mastra/memory/processors`. See [Read extracted values from a stream](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/observational-memory) for a consumer example.

### `data-om-status`

Emitted once per agent loop step, before model generation. Provides a snapshot of the current memory state, including token usage for both context windows and the state of any async buffered content.

```typescript
interface DataOmStatusPart {
  type: 'data-om-status'
  data: {
    windows: {
      active: {
        /** Unobserved message tokens and the threshold that triggers observation */
        messages: { tokens: number; threshold: number }
        /** Observation tokens and the threshold that triggers reflection */
        observations: { tokens: number; threshold: number }
      }
      buffered: {
        observations: {
          /** Number of buffered chunks staged for activation */
          chunks: number
          /** Total message tokens across all buffered chunks */
          messageTokens: number
          /** Projected message tokens that would be removed if activation happened now (based on bufferActivation ratio and chunk boundaries) */
          projectedMessageRemoval: number
          /** Observation tokens that will be added on activation */
          observationTokens: number
          /** idle: no buffering in progress. running: background observer is working. complete: chunks are ready for activation. */
          status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'complete'
        }
        reflection: {
          /** Observation tokens that were fed into the reflector (pre-compression size) */
          inputObservationTokens: number

`buffered.reflection.inputObservationTokens` is the size of the observations that were sent to the Reflector. `buffered.reflection.observationTokens` is the compressed result: the size of what will replace those observations when the reflection activates. A client can use these two values to show a compression ratio.

Clients can derive percentages and post-activation estimates from the raw values:

```typescript
// Message window usage %
const msgPercent = status.windows.active.messages.tokens / status.windows.active.messages.threshold

// Observation window usage %
const obsPercent =
  status.windows.active.observations.tokens / status.windows.active.observations.threshold

// Projected message tokens after buffered observations activate
// Uses projectedMessageRemoval which accounts for bufferActivation ratio and chunk boundaries
const postActivation =
  status.windows.active.messages.tokens -
  status.windows.buffered.observations.projectedMessageRemoval

// Reflection compression ratio (when buffered reflection exists)
const { inputObservationTokens, observationTokens } = status.windows.buffered.reflection
if (inputObservationTokens > 0) {
  const compressionRatio = observationTokens / inputObservationTokens
}
```

## Standalone usage

Most users should use the `Memory` class above. Using `ObservationalMemory` directly is mainly useful for benchmarking, experimentation, or when you need to control processor ordering with other processors (like [guardrails](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/guardrails)).

The `ObservationalMemory` class is the engine; to attach it to an agent, wrap it in an `ObservationalMemoryProcessor`, which needs a `Memory` instance for loading and persisting messages. Note that `stores.memory` is typed as optional on storage adapters, so a non-null assertion (or a runtime check) is needed:

```typescript
import { ObservationalMemory, ObservationalMemoryProcessor } from '@mastra/memory/processors'
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory'
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql'

const storage = new LibSQLStore({
  id: 'my-storage',
  url: 'file:./memory.db',
})

const memory = new Memory({ storage })

const om = new ObservationalMemory({
  storage: storage.stores.memory!,
  memory,
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  scope: 'resource',
  observation: {
    messageTokens: 20_000,
  },
  reflection: {
    observationTokens: 60_000,
  },
})

const omProcessor = new ObservationalMemoryProcessor(om, memory)

export const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-agent',
  name: 'my-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-mini',
  inputProcessors: [omProcessor],
  outputProcessors: [omProcessor],
})
```

### Standalone config

The standalone `ObservationalMemory` class accepts all the same options as the `observationalMemory` config object above, plus the following:

**storage** (`MemoryStorage`): Storage adapter for persisting observations. Must be a MemoryStorage instance (from MastraStorage.stores.memory).

**onDebugEvent** (`(event: ObservationDebugEvent) => void`): Debug callback for observation events. Called whenever observation-related events occur. Useful for debugging and understanding the observation flow.

**obscureThreadIds** (`boolean`): When enabled, thread IDs are hashed before being included in observation context. This prevents the LLM from recognizing patterns in thread identifiers. Automatically enabled when using resource scope through the Memory class. (Default: `false`)

## Recall tool

When `retrieval` is set (any truthy value), a `recall` tool is registered so the agent can page through raw messages behind observation group ranges. By default (scope `'resource'`), the tool supports listing threads (`mode: "threads"`), browsing other threads (`threadId`), and cross-thread search. With `retrieval: { vector: true }`, semantic search is available (`mode: "search"`). Set `scope: 'thread'` to restrict the tool to the current thread only. The tool is automatically added to the agent's tool list.

Mastra also injects scope-aware usage instructions into the agent's context. For resource scope with `vector: true`, these cover routing between `search`, `threads`, and `messages`, including fallback to thread discovery when search results are unsuitable. Without `vector: true`, the instructions only cover `threads` and `messages` browsing, so the agent isn't steered toward a search mode that isn't configured. Resource-scoped instructions are injected even before any observation group exists, so the agent can browse other threads from the first message. Use `retrieval: { instructions: '...' }` to append application-specific guidance after the built-in instructions.

### Parameters

**mode** (`'messages' | 'threads' | 'search'`): What to retrieve. "messages" (default) pages through message history. "threads" lists all threads for the current user. "search" finds messages by semantic similarity across all threads (requires vector store and embedder). (Default: `'messages'`)

**query** (`string`): Search query for mode: "search". Finds messages semantically similar to this text across all threads for the current user.

**cursor** (`string`): A message ID to anchor the recall query. Extract the start or end ID from an observation group range (e.g. from \_range: \startId:endId\\\_, use either startId or endId). If a range string is passed directly, the tool returns a hint explaining how to extract the correct ID. When both cursor and threadId are omitted for mode: "messages", the tool browses the current thread from the position set by anchor.

**threadId** (`string`): Browse a different thread by its ID, or pass "current" for the active thread. Use mode: "threads" first to discover thread IDs. When provided without a cursor, reading starts from the beginning of the thread.

**anchor** (`'start' | 'end'`): For mode: "messages" without a cursor, page from the start (oldest-first) or end (newest-first) of the thread. (Default: `'start'`)

**page** (`number`): Pagination offset. For messages: positive values page forward from cursor, negative values page backward. For threads: page number (0-indexed). 0 is treated as 1 for messages. (Default: `1`)

**limit** (`number`): Maximum number of items to return per page. (Default: `20`)

**detail** (`'low' | 'high'`): Controls how much content is shown per message part. 'low' shows truncated text and tool names with positional indices (\[p0], \[p1]). 'high' shows full content including tool arguments and results, clamped to one part per call with continuation hints. (Default: `'low'`)

**partType** (`'text' | 'tool-call' | 'tool-result' | 'reasoning' | 'image' | 'file'`): Filter results to only include message parts of this type. Only applies to mode: "messages".

**toolName** (`string`): Filter results to only include tool-call and tool-result parts matching this tool name. Only applies to mode: "messages".

**partIndex** (`number`): Fetch a single message part at full detail by its positional index. Use this when a low-detail recall shows an interesting part at \[p1] — call again with partIndex: 1 to see the full content without loading every part.

**before** (`string`): For mode: "threads" only. Filter to threads created before this date. Accepts ISO 8601 format (e.g. "2026-03-15", "2026-03-10T00:00:00Z").

**after** (`string`): For mode: "threads" only. Filter to threads created after this date. Accepts ISO 8601 format (e.g. "2026-03-01", "2026-03-10T00:00:00Z").

### Returns (messages mode)

**messages** (`string`): Formatted message content. Format depends on the detail level.

**count** (`number`): Number of messages in this page.

**cursor** (`string`): The cursor message ID used for this query.

**page** (`number`): The page number returned.

**limit** (`number`): The limit used for this query.

**detail** (`'low' | 'high'`): The detail level used for this query.

**hasNextPage** (`boolean`): Whether more messages exist after this page.

**hasPrevPage** (`boolean`): Whether more messages exist before this page.

**truncated** (`boolean`): Present and true when the output was capped by the token budget. The agent can paginate or use partIndex to access remaining content.

**tokenOffset** (`number`): Approximate number of tokens that were trimmed when truncated is true.

### Returns (threads mode)

**threads** (`string`): Formatted thread listing. Each thread shows its title, ID, and dates. The current thread is marked with ← current.

**count** (`number`): Number of threads returned.

**page** (`number`): The page number returned.

**hasMore** (`boolean`): Whether more threads exist on the next page.

### Returns (search mode)

**results** (`string`): Formatted search results grouped by thread. Each result shows the thread title, thread ID, relevance score, message preview, and a cursor ID for browsing into that thread.

**count** (`number`): Number of matching messages found.

### ModelByInputTokens

`ModelByInputTokens` selects a model based on the input token count. It chooses the model for the smallest threshold that covers the actual input size.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new ModelByInputTokens(config)
```

Where `config` is an object with `upTo` keys that map token thresholds (numbers) to model targets.

#### Example

```typescript
import { ModelByInputTokens } from '@mastra/memory'

const selector = new ModelByInputTokens({
  upTo: {
    10_000: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash', // Fast for small inputs
    40_000: 'openai/gpt-5-mini', // Stronger for medium inputs
    1_000_000: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol', // Most capable for large inputs
  },
})
```

#### Behavior

- Thresholds are sorted internally, so the order in the config object doesn't matter.
- `inputTokens ≤ smallest threshold` → uses that threshold's model
- `inputTokens > largest threshold` → `resolve()` throws an error. If this happens during an OM Observer or Reflector run, OM aborts via TripWire, so callers receive an empty `text` result or streamed `tripwire` instead of a normal assistant response.
- OM computes the input token count for the Observer or Reflector call and resolves the matching model tier directly

#### Methods

**resolve** (`(inputTokens: number) => MastraModelConfig`): Returns the model for the given input token count. Throws if inputTokens exceeds the largest configured threshold. When this happens during an OM run, callers receive a TripWire/empty-text outcome instead of a normal assistant response.

**getThresholds** (`() => number[]`): Returns the configured thresholds in ascending order. Useful for introspection.
