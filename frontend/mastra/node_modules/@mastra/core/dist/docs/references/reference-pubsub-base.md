# PubSub

`PubSub` is the abstract base class for Mastra's event system. It defines the contract that every pub/sub backend implements, so the rest of Mastra can publish and subscribe to events without knowing which transport is in use.

Mastra uses pub/sub internally for workflow event processing, streaming, and cross-component communication. Most applications use the default [`EventEmitterPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/event-emitter) and never construct a `PubSub` directly. Implement this class only when you need a custom transport.

For built-in implementations, see [`EventEmitterPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/event-emitter), [`UnixSocketPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/unix-socket-pubsub), [`CachingPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/caching-pubsub), [`RedisStreamsPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/redis-streams), and [`GoogleCloudPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/google-cloud-pubsub).

## Usage example

Extend `PubSub` and implement the four abstract methods to add a custom backend.

```typescript
import { PubSub } from '@mastra/core/events'
import type { Event, EventCallback, SubscribeOptions } from '@mastra/core/events'

export class CustomPubSub extends PubSub {
  async publish(topic: string, event: Omit<Event, 'id' | 'createdAt'>): Promise<void> {
    // Deliver the event to subscribers of `topic`.
  }

  async subscribe(topic: string, cb: EventCallback, options?: SubscribeOptions): Promise<void> {
    // Register `cb` to receive events published to `topic`.
  }

  async unsubscribe(topic: string, cb: EventCallback): Promise<void> {
    // Remove a previously registered callback.
  }

  async flush(): Promise<void> {
    // Wait for any in-flight deliveries to settle.
  }
}
```

Pass the instance to the [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/reference/core/mastra-class) constructor:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { CustomPubSub } from './pubsub'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  pubsub: new CustomPubSub(),
})
```

## Delivery modes

A `PubSub` declares which delivery modes it supports through the `supportedModes` property. Mastra reads this to decide whether to run a long-lived worker that pulls events.

| Mode   | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pull` | Consumers actively read from the broker, for example Redis Streams `XREADGROUP`. Mastra runs an orchestration worker to read. |
| `push` | Events arrive without the consumer asking, either in-process or through an HTTP endpoint. No read loop is required.           |

The default is `['pull']` so that custom implementations keep today's behavior unless they opt in to push delivery.

## Methods

### Core methods

#### `publish(topic, event)`

Publishes an event to a topic. The `id` and `createdAt` fields are assigned by the implementation.

```typescript
await pubsub.publish('my-topic', {
  type: 'example',
  data: { value: 1 },
  runId: 'run-123',
})
```

#### `subscribe(topic, cb, options?)`

Registers a callback to receive events published to a topic. When `options.group` is set, subscribers in the same group compete for messages and each event is delivered to one member. Without a group, every subscriber receives every event.

Pass `options.batch` to opt in to batched delivery. The callback signature is unchanged: a batch of N events is delivered as N consecutive `cb(event, ack, nack)` calls in publish order. Batching is honored only when the backend's [`supportsNativeBatching`](#properties) is `true`. Other backends ignore the option and deliver events one at a time.

```typescript
await pubsub.subscribe('my-topic', (event, ack, nack) => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

#### `unsubscribe(topic, cb)`

Removes a previously registered callback from a topic.

```typescript
await pubsub.unsubscribe('my-topic', callback)
```

#### `flush()`

Waits for any in-flight deliveries to settle. Call this before shutdown to avoid dropping events.

```typescript
await pubsub.flush()
```

#### `clearTopic(topic)`

Deletes all retained state for a topic (cached history, persistent stream entries, and consumer groups) once no more events will be published to it. Mastra's run lifecycles (durable agents and the evented workflow engine) call this automatically when a run reaches a terminal state, so per-run topics don't accumulate on transports that retain messages.

The default implementation is a no-op: transports that retain nothing per topic (such as `EventEmitterPubSub`) have nothing to clear. Backends that persist messages, like [`RedisStreamsPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/redis-streams), override it. The contract is best-effort: implementations log failures rather than throwing, because callers invoke it fire-and-forget at cleanup boundaries.

```typescript
await pubsub.clearTopic('workflow.events.v2.run-123')
```

### Replay methods

These methods support resuming a stream after a disconnect. The default implementations fall back to a regular `subscribe`, so backends without history support behave as live-only. [`CachingPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/caching-pubsub) overrides them to replay cached events.

#### `getHistory(topic, offset?)`

Returns cached events for a topic, starting at `offset`. Returns an empty array when the backend has no history.

```typescript
const events = await pubsub.getHistory('my-topic', 0)
```

Returns: `Promise<Event[]>`

#### `subscribeWithReplay(topic, cb)`

Replays cached events, then subscribes to live events.

```typescript
await pubsub.subscribeWithReplay('my-topic', event => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

#### `subscribeFromOffset(topic, offset, cb)`

Replays cached events starting at a known position, then subscribes to live events. This is more efficient than a full replay when the client knows its last position.

```typescript
await pubsub.subscribeFromOffset('my-topic', 42, event => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

## Properties

**supportedModes** (`ReadonlyArray<"pull" | "push">`): Delivery modes the implementation supports. Defaults to \["pull"].

**supportsNativeBatching** (`boolean`): Whether the implementation honors options.batch on subscribe(). Defaults to false. Backends that integrate batching internally override this and return true.

## Types

### `Event`

**type** (`string`): Event type identifier.

**id** (`string`): Unique event ID, assigned by the implementation on publish.

**data** (`any`): Event payload.

**runId** (`string`): Run the event belongs to.

**createdAt** (`Date`): Timestamp assigned by the implementation on publish.

**index** (`number`): Sequential position used to resume from a specific offset.

**deliveryAttempt** (`number`): Number of times the event has been delivered. Starts at 1. Defaults to 1 when the backend does not track redelivery.

### `SubscribeOptions`

**group** (`string`): When set, subscribers with the same group compete for messages and each event is delivered to one member. When omitted, every subscriber receives every event.

**batch** (`SubscribeBatchOptions`): Opt in to batched delivery for this subscription. When omitted, events are delivered one at a time. Honored only by backends where supportsNativeBatching is true.

### `SubscribeBatchOptions`

Per-subscription batching policy. The callback signature doesn't change. A batch of N events becomes N consecutive callback invocations in publish order.

**maxSize** (`number`): Maximum events held before forcing a flush.

**maxWaitMs** (`number`): Maximum time in milliseconds the oldest event may sit in the buffer. The timer starts when the buffer transitions from empty to non-empty.

**minIntervalMs** (`number`): Minimum time in milliseconds between consecutive batch deliveries. Even when maxSize or maxWaitMs would fire, the buffer holds until this interval has elapsed since the last delivery.

**isImmediate** (`(event: Event) => boolean`): When it returns true for an event, the buffer flushes immediately on publish, subject to minIntervalMs. A per-event escape hatch.

**coalesce** (`(events: Event[]) => Event[]`): Applied to the queued batch before delivery to drop superseded events. Must return a subset of its input by reference identity; returning freshly constructed Event objects is a contract violation and discards the whole batch. Ordering of kept events is preserved.

**maxBufferSize** (`number`): Maximum events the buffer may hold before overflow handling kicks in. Events flagged immediate are never dropped on overflow. (Default: `256`)

**overflow** (`"drop-oldest" | "drop-newest" | "coalesce-or-drop-oldest"`): Overflow strategy when the buffer exceeds maxBufferSize. coalesce-or-drop-oldest runs coalesce first, then drops oldest if still over budget. (Default: `coalesce-or-drop-oldest`)

### `EventCallback`

The callback signature for subscribers: `(event: Event, ack?: () => Promise<void>, nack?: () => Promise<void>) => void`.

**event** (`Event`): The delivered event.

**ack** (`() => Promise<void>`): Acknowledge successful processing. The event is removed from the queue.

**nack** (`() => Promise<void>`): Negative acknowledge. The event is requeued for redelivery after a delay.
