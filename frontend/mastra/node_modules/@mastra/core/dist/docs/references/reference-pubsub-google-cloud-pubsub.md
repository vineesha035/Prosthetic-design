# GoogleCloudPubSub

`GoogleCloudPubSub` is a [`PubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/base) implementation backed by [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs). It delivers events across processes and hosts using Google Cloud topics and subscriptions, with ordered delivery and message acknowledgment.

Use it for distributed deployments on Google Cloud. For single-process delivery, use [`EventEmitterPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/event-emitter). For Redis, use [`RedisStreamsPubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/redis-streams).

Each topic maps to a Google Cloud topic. Subscriptions with a group share a subscription, so members compete for events. Subscriptions without a group create a per-instance subscription, so every instance receives every event.

## Installation

**npm**:

```bash
npm install @mastra/google-cloud-pubsub
```

**pnpm**:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/google-cloud-pubsub
```

**Yarn**:

```bash
yarn add @mastra/google-cloud-pubsub
```

**Bun**:

```bash
bun add @mastra/google-cloud-pubsub
```

## Usage example

Pass a Google Cloud client configuration, such as a project ID.

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { GoogleCloudPubSub } from '@mastra/google-cloud-pubsub'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  pubsub: new GoogleCloudPubSub({
    projectId: 'my-project',
  }),
})
```

## Constructor parameters

**config** (`ClientConfig`): Configuration for the Google Cloud Pub/Sub client, including credentials and project ID. See the @google-cloud/pubsub client documentation for all fields.

## Methods

`GoogleCloudPubSub` implements the [`PubSub`](https://mastra.ai/reference/pubsub/base) contract. The methods below are specific to this implementation.

### `init(topicName, group?)`

Creates the topic and a subscription if they don't already exist, and returns the subscription. `subscribe` calls this internally, so you rarely call it directly.

```typescript
await pubsub.init('workflow.events')
```

### `subscribe(topic, cb, options?)`

Subscribes to a topic. With `options.group`, members of the group share a subscription and compete for events. Without a group, the instance receives every event through its own subscription.

```typescript
await pubsub.subscribe('workflow.events', (event, ack, nack) => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

### `flush()`

Waits for pending acknowledgments to complete.

```typescript
await pubsub.flush()
```

### `destroy(topicName)`

Removes the subscription and topic for a topic name. Use this to clean up Google Cloud resources.

```typescript
await pubsub.destroy('workflow.events')
```

## Acknowledgment

Each delivered event includes `ack` and `nack` functions. Call `ack` after successful processing to remove the event from the subscription. When neither is called, Google Cloud redelivers the event after its acknowledgment deadline expires.
