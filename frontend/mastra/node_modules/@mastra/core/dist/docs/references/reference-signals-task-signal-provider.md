# TaskSignalProvider

Bundles the built-in task tools (`task_write`, `task_update`, `task_complete`, `task_check`) and the `TaskStateProcessor` behind a single agent registration. Use it to add a structured, durable task list to an agent without wiring the tools and processor separately.

Extends [`SignalProvider`](https://mastra.ai/reference/signals/signal-provider). The task list is stored in the thread-scoped `tasks` storage domain (the source of truth) and projected onto the agent state-signal lane by the processor, so it survives observational-memory truncation without invalidating the prompt cache.

## Usage example

Register the provider on an agent that has `Memory` and a Mastra `storage`:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { TaskSignalProvider } from '@mastra/core/signals'

const agent = new Agent({
  id: 'coder',
  name: 'coder',
  instructions: '...',
  model,
  memory,
  signals: [new TaskSignalProvider()],
})
```

The Agent automatically merges the four task tools into its toolset and registers the processor on its input-processor chain. No other wiring is required.

Task tracking requires a memory-backed thread (`threadId` + `resourceId`). Without memory the task tools no-op and return a result explaining that task tracking requires agent memory. The `tasks` storage domain is wired in-memory by default, so task tracking works without configuring a storage backend.

## Constructor parameters

`TaskSignalProvider` takes no constructor arguments.

## Properties

**id** (`'task-signals'`): Stable identifier for the provider instance.

## Methods

### Agent integration

These methods are called automatically by the Agent when the provider is passed to `signals`. You normally don't call them directly.

#### `getTools()`

Returns the four task tools keyed by their tool ids (`task_write`, `task_update`, `task_complete`, `task_check`). The Agent merges these into its toolset.

```typescript
const tools = new TaskSignalProvider().getTools()
// { task_write, task_update, task_complete, task_check }
```

Returns: `Record<string, Tool>`

#### `getInputProcessors()`

Returns the provider's `TaskStateProcessor` instance. The Agent registers it on the input-processor chain, which propagates the Mastra instance so the processor can resolve the `tasks` store.

```typescript
const [processor] = new TaskSignalProvider().getInputProcessors()
// processor instanceof TaskStateProcessor
```

Returns: `InputProcessorOrWorkflow[]`
