# Run.resumeStream()

The `.resumeStream()` method resumes a suspended workflow run with new data, allowing you to continue execution from a specific step and to observe the stream of events.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun()

const stream = run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: 'initial data',
  },
})

const result = await stream.result

if (result!.status === 'suspended') {
  const resumedStream = await run.resumeStream({
    resumeData: {
      value: 'resume data',
    },
  })
}
```

## Parameters

**resumeData** (`z.infer<TInput>`): Input data that matches the workflow's input schema

**requestContext** (`RequestContext`): Request Context data to use during workflow execution

**step** (`Step<string, any, any, any, any, TEngineType>`): The step to resume execution from

**forEachIndex** (`number`): Target a specific iteration of a suspended .foreach() step. Pass the zero-based index of the iteration to resume; other iterations remain suspended. Omit to resume all suspended iterations of the step with the same resumeData.

**tracingOptions** (`TracingOptions`): Options for Tracing configuration.

**tracingOptions.metadata** (`Record<string, any>`): Metadata to add to the root trace span. Useful for adding custom attributes like user IDs, session IDs, or feature flags.

**tracingOptions.requestContextKeys** (`string[]`): Additional RequestContext keys to extract as metadata for this trace. Supports dot notation for nested values (e.g., 'user.id').

**tracingOptions.traceId** (`string`): Trace ID to use for this execution (1-32 hexadecimal characters). If provided, this trace will be part of the specified trace.

**tracingOptions.parentSpanId** (`string`): Parent span ID to use for this execution (1-16 hexadecimal characters). If provided, the root span will be created as a child of this span.

**tracingOptions.tags** (`string[]`): Tags to apply to this trace. String labels for categorizing and filtering traces.

## Returns

**stream** (`MastraWorkflowStream<ChunkType>`): A custom stream that extends ReadableStream\<ChunkType> with additional workflow-specific properties

**stream.status** (`Promise<RunStatus>`): A promise that resolves to the current workflow run status

**stream.result** (`Promise<WorkflowResult<TState, TOutput, TSteps>>`): A promise that resolves to the final workflow result

**stream.usage** (`Promise<{ inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number; totalTokens: number, reasoningTokens?: number, cacheInputTokens?: number }>`): A promise that resolves to token usage statistics

## Stream events

The stream emits event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics. For successful runs, `payload.finalWorkflowResult` carries the workflow's final result
