# MCPServer

The `MCPServer` class provides the functionality to expose your existing Mastra tools and Agents as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This allows any MCP client (like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop) to connect to these capabilities and make them available to an agent.

Note that if you only need to use your tools or agents directly within your Mastra application, you don't necessarily need to create an MCP server. This API is specifically for exposing your Mastra tools and agents to _external_ MCP clients.

It supports both [stdio (subprocess) and SSE (HTTP) MCP transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports).

## Constructor

To create a new `MCPServer`, you need to provide some basic information about your server, the tools it will offer, and optionally, any agents you want to expose as tools.

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { dataProcessingWorkflow } from '../workflows/dataProcessingWorkflow'

const myAgent = new Agent({
  id: 'my-example-agent',
  name: 'MyExampleAgent',
  description: 'A generalist to help with basic questions.',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
})

const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Gets the current weather for a location.',
  inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
  execute: async inputData => `Weather in ${inputData.location} is sunny.`,
})

const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'my-custom-server',
  name: 'My Custom Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'A server that provides weather data and agent capabilities',
  instructions:
    'Use the available tools to help users with weather information and data processing tasks.',
  tools: { weatherTool },
  agents: { myAgent }, // this agent will become tool "ask_myAgent"
  workflows: {
    dataProcessingWorkflow, // this workflow will become tool "run_dataProcessingWorkflow"
  },
})
```

### Configuration Properties

The constructor accepts an `MCPServerConfig` object with the following properties:

**id** (`string`): Unique identifier for the server. This ID is preserved when the server is registered with Mastra and can be used to retrieve the server via getMCPServerById().

**name** (`string`): A descriptive name for your server (e.g., 'My Weather and Agent Server').

**version** (`string`): The semantic version of your server (e.g., '1.0.0').

**tools** (`ToolsInput`): An object where keys are tool names and values are Mastra tool definitions (created with createTool or Vercel AI SDK). These tools will be directly exposed.

**agents** (`Record<string, Agent>`): An object where keys are agent identifiers and values are Mastra Agent instances. Each agent will be automatically converted into a tool named ask\_\<agentIdentifier>. The agent \*\*must\*\* have a non-empty description string property defined in its constructor configuration. This description will be used in the tool's description. If an agent's description is missing or empty, an error will be thrown during MCPServer initialization.

**workflows** (`Record<string, Workflow>`): An object where keys are workflow identifiers and values are Mastra Workflow instances. Each workflow is converted into a tool named run\_\<workflowKey>. The workflow's inputSchema becomes the tool's input schema. The workflow \*\*must\*\* have a non-empty description string property, which is used for the tool's description. If a workflow's description is missing or empty, an error will be thrown. The tool executes the workflow by calling workflow\.createRun() followed by run.start({ inputData: \<tool\_input> }). If a tool name derived from an agent or workflow (e.g., ask\_myAgent or run\_myWorkflow) collides with an explicitly defined tool name or another derived name, the explicitly defined tool takes precedence, and a warning is logged. Agents/workflows leading to subsequent collisions are skipped.

**description** (`string`): Optional description of what the MCP server does.

**instructions** (`string`): Optional instructions describing how to use the server and its features.

**mapAuthInfoToUser** (`({ authInfo, extra, requestContext }) => unknown | null | undefined | Promise<unknown | null | undefined>`): Maps MCP transport auth data from extra.authInfo into the user value used by Mastra FGA checks. Use this when an OAuth-protected MCP server is registered on a Mastra instance with an FGA provider.

**fga** (`{ resourceMapping?: Partial<Record<'tool' | 'tools', { fgaResourceType: string; deriveId?: ({ user, resourceId, requestContext }) => string | undefined }>>; permissionMapping?: Record<string, string> }`): Overrides resource and permission mappings for this MCP server's tools/list and tools/call FGA checks. Use this when MCP authorization should be scoped differently from internal agent or workflow tool execution.

**repository** (`Repository`): Optional repository information for the server's source code.

**releaseDate** (`string`): Optional release date of this server version (ISO 8601 string). Defaults to the time of instantiation if not provided.

**isLatest** (`boolean`): Optional flag indicating if this is the latest version. Defaults to true if not provided.

**packageCanonical** (`'npm' | 'docker' | 'pypi' | 'crates' | string`): Optional canonical packaging format if the server is distributed as a package (e.g., 'npm', 'docker').

**packages** (`PackageInfo[]`): Optional list of installable packages for this server.

**remotes** (`RemoteInfo[]`): Optional list of remote access points for this server.

**resources** (`MCPServerResources`): An object defining how the server should handle MCP resources. See Resource Handling section for details.

**prompts** (`MCPServerPrompts`): An object defining how the server should handle MCP prompts. See Prompt Handling section for details.

**appResources** (`AppResources`): A map of ui:// URIs to app resource configurations. Each entry defines an interactive HTML UI served via the MCP Apps extension (SEP-1865). See the MCP Apps section for details.

## Exposing agents as tools

A powerful feature of `MCPServer` is its ability to automatically expose your Mastra Agents as callable tools. When you provide agents in the `agents` property of the configuration:

- **Tool Naming**: Each agent is converted into a tool named `ask_<agentKey>`, where `<agentKey>` is the key you used for that agent in the `agents` object. For instance, if you configure `agents: { myAgentKey: myAgentInstance }`, a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` will be created.

- **Tool Functionality**:

  - **Description**: The generated tool's description will be in the format: "Ask agent `<AgentName>` a question. Original agent instructions: `<agent description>`".
  - **Input**: The tool expects a single object argument with a `message` property (string): `{ message: "Your question for the agent" }`.
  - **Execution**: When this tool is called, it invokes the corresponding agent's `generate()` method with the provided `query`.
  - **Output**: The direct result from the agent's `generate()` method is returned as the output of the tool.

- **Name collisions.** If an explicit tool defined in the `tools` configuration has the same name as an agent-derived tool (e.g., a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` alongside an agent keyed as `myAgentKey`), the _explicitly defined tool will take precedence_. The agent won't be converted into a tool in this conflicting case, and a warning will be logged.

This makes it straightforward to allow MCP clients to interact with your agents using natural language queries, like any other tool.

### Agent-to-Tool Conversion

When you provide agents in the `agents` configuration property, `MCPServer` will automatically create a corresponding tool for each agent. The tool will be `ask_<agentIdentifier>`, where `<agentIdentifier>` is the key you used in the `agents` object.

The description for this generated tool will be: "Ask agent `<agent.name>` a question. Agent description: `<agent.description>`".

For an agent to be converted into a tool, it **must** have a non-empty `description` string property set in its configuration when it was instantiated (e.g., `new Agent({ id: 'my-agent', name: 'myAgent', description: 'This agent does X.', ... })`). If an agent is passed to `MCPServer` with a missing or empty `description`, an error will be thrown when the `MCPServer` is instantiated, and server setup will fail.

This allows you to quickly expose the generative capabilities of your agents through the MCP, enabling clients to "ask" your agents questions directly.

### Accessing MCP Context in Tools

Tools exposed through `MCPServer` can access MCP request context (authentication, session IDs, etc.) via two different properties depending on how the tool is invoked:

| Call Pattern     | Access Method                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Direct tool call | `context?.mcp?.extra`                       |
| Agent tool call  | `context?.requestContext?.get("mcp.extra")` |

**Universal pattern** (works in both contexts):

```typescript
const mcpExtra = context?.mcp?.extra ?? context?.requestContext?.get('mcp.extra')
const authInfo = mcpExtra?.authInfo
```

#### Example: Tool that works in both contexts

```typescript
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { z } from 'zod'

const fetchUserData = createTool({
  id: 'fetchUserData',
  description: 'Fetches user data using authentication from MCP context',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string().describe('The ID of the user to fetch'),
  }),
  execute: async (inputData, context) => {
    // Access MCP authentication context
    // When called directly via MCP: context.mcp.extra
    // When called via agent: context.requestContext.get('mcp.extra')
    const mcpExtra = context?.mcp?.extra || context?.requestContext?.get('mcp.extra')
    const authInfo = mcpExtra?.authInfo

    if (!authInfo?.token) {
      throw new Error('Authentication required')
    }

    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${inputData.userId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${authInfo.token}`,
      },
    })

    return response.json()
  },
})
```

## Methods

These are the functions you can call on an `MCPServer` instance to control its behavior and get information.

### `startStdio()`

Use this method to start the server so it communicates using standard input and output (stdio). This is typical when running the server as a command-line program.

```typescript
async startStdio(): Promise<void>
```

Here's how you would start the server using stdio:

```typescript
const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'my-server',
  name: 'My Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {/* ... */},
})
await server.startStdio()
```

### `startSSE()`

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/sse`:

```typescript
import http from 'http'

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || '', `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: '/sse',
    messagePath: '/message',
    req,
    res,
  })
})

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startSSE` method:

**url** (`URL`): The web address the user is requesting.

**ssePath** (`string`): The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/sse').

**messagePath** (`string`): The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').

**req** (`any`): The incoming request object from your web server.

**res** (`any`): The response object from your web server, used to send data back.

### `startHonoSSE()`

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startHonoSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHonoSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/hono-sse`:

```typescript
import http from 'http'

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHonoSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || '', `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: '/hono-sse',
    messagePath: '/message',
    req,
    res,
  })
})

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHonoSSE` method:

**url** (`URL`): The web address the user is requesting.

**ssePath** (`string`): The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/hono-sse').

**messagePath** (`string`): The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').

**req** (`any`): The incoming request object from your web server.

**res** (`any`): The response object from your web server, used to send data back.

### `startHTTP()`

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use streamable HTTP for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives HTTP requests.

```typescript
async startHTTP({
  url,
  httpPath,
  req,
  res,
  options = { sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID() },
}: {
  url: URL;
  httpPath: string;
  req: http.IncomingMessage;
  res: http.ServerResponse<http.IncomingMessage>;
  options?: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHTTP` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/http`:

```typescript
import http from 'http'

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHTTP({
    url: new URL(req.url || '', 'http://localhost:1234'),
    httpPath: `/mcp`,
    req,
    res,
    options: {
      sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID(),
    },
  })
})

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

For **serverless environments** (Supabase Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, etc.), use `serverless: true` to enable stateless operation:

```typescript
// Supabase Edge Function example
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
// Note: You will need to convert req/res format from Deno to Node
import { toReqRes, toFetchResponse } from 'fetch-to-node'

const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'my-serverless-mcp',
  name: 'My Serverless MCP',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {/* your tools */},
})

serve(async req => {
  const url = new URL(req.url)

  if (url.pathname === '/mcp') {
    // Convert Deno Request to Node.js-compatible format
    const { req: nodeReq, res: nodeRes } = toReqRes(req)

    await server.startHTTP({
      url,
      httpPath: '/mcp',
      req: nodeReq,
      res: nodeRes,
      options: {
        serverless: true, // ← Enable stateless mode for serverless
      },
    })

    return toFetchResponse(nodeRes)
  }

  return new Response('Not found', { status: 404 })
})
```

> **When to use serverless: true:** Use `serverless: true` when deploying to environments where each request runs in a fresh, stateless execution context:
>
> - Supabase Edge Functions
> - Cloudflare Workers
> - Vercel Edge Functions
> - Netlify Edge Functions
> - AWS Lambda
> - Deno Deploy
>
> Use the default session-based mode (without `serverless: true`) for:
>
> - Long-lived Node.js servers
> - Docker containers
> - Traditional hosting (VPS, dedicated servers)
>
> The serverless mode disables session management and creates fresh server instances per request, which is necessary for stateless environments where memory doesn't persist between invocations.
>
> By default, serverless mode buffers each request into a single JSON response, so `notifications/progress` sent by a tool never reach the client. Set `serverlessStreaming: true` to handle the request with request-scoped SSE streaming instead, which delivers progress notifications before the final result:
>
> ```typescript
> await server.startHTTP({
>   url,
>   httpPath: '/mcp',
>   req: nodeReq,
>   res: nodeRes,
>   options: {
>     serverless: true,
>     serverlessStreaming: true, // ← Stream request-scoped notifications/progress
>   },
> })
> ```
>
> This is still stateless: no `mcp-session-id` is required or persisted. It only enables notifications scoped to the current request (such as progress). The session-dependent features below remain unavailable.
>
> The following MCP features require session state or persistent connections and **won't work** in serverless mode (including with `serverlessStreaming: true`):
>
> - **Elicitation** - Interactive user input requests during tool execution require session management to route responses back to the correct client
> - **Resource subscriptions** - `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` need persistent connections to maintain subscription state
> - **Resource update notifications** - `resources.notifyUpdated()` requires active subscriptions and persistent connections to notify clients
> - **Prompt list change notifications** - `prompts.notifyListChanged()` requires persistent connections to push updates to clients
> - **Tool list change notifications** - `toolActions.notifyListChanged()` requires persistent connections to push updates to clients
> - **Server log notifications** - `sendLoggingMessage()` requires persistent connections to push log messages to clients
>
> These features work normally in long-lived server environments (Node.js servers, Docker containers, etc.).

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHTTP` method:

**url** (`URL`): The web address the user is requesting.

**httpPath** (`string`): The specific part of the URL where the MCP server will handle HTTP requests (e.g., '/mcp').

**req** (`http.IncomingMessage`): The incoming request object from your web server.

**res** (`http.ServerResponse`): The response object from your web server, used to send data back.

**options** (`StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions`): Optional configuration for the HTTP transport. See the options table below for more details.

The `StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions` object allows you to customize the behavior of the HTTP transport. Here are the available options:

**serverless** (`boolean`): If true, runs in stateless mode without session management. Each request is handled independently with a fresh server instance. Essential for serverless environments (Cloudflare Workers, Supabase Edge Functions, Vercel Edge, etc.) where sessions cannot persist between invocations. Defaults to false.

**serverlessStreaming** (`boolean`): If true, serverless requests use request-scoped SSE streaming instead of a buffered JSON response, allowing in-request notifications/progress to reach the client before the final result. Only takes effect together with serverless: true. Defaults to false (buffered JSON responses), which preserves backward-compatible behavior. It enables only request-scoped notifications such as progress; elicitation, subscriptions, and out-of-request notifications still require session state.

**sessionIdGenerator** (`(() => string) | undefined`): A function that generates a unique session ID. This should be a cryptographically secure, globally unique string. Return undefined to disable session management.

**onsessioninitialized** (`(sessionId: string) => void`): A callback that is invoked when a new session is initialized. This is useful for tracking active MCP sessions.

**enableJsonResponse** (`boolean`): If true, the server will return plain JSON responses instead of using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming. Defaults to false.

**eventStore** (`EventStore`): An event store for message resumability. Providing this enables clients to reconnect and resume message streams.

### `close()`

This method closes the server and releases all resources.

```typescript
async close(): Promise<void>
```

### `getServerInfo()`

The method returns the server's basic information.

```typescript
getServerInfo(): ServerInfo
```

### `getServerDetail()`

The method returns details about the server's information.

```typescript
getServerDetail(): ServerDetail
```

### `getToolListInfo()`

The method returns the tools that were set up when you created the server. It's a read-only list, useful for debugging purposes.

```typescript
getToolListInfo(): ToolListInfo
```

### `getToolInfo()`

The method returns details about a specific tool.

```typescript
getToolInfo(toolName: string): ToolInfo
```

### `executeTool()`

This method executes a specific tool and returns the result.

```typescript
executeTool(toolName: string, input: any): Promise<any>
```

### `getStdioTransport()`

If you started the server with `startStdio()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the stdio communication. This is mostly for checking things internally or for testing.

```typescript
getStdioTransport(): StdioServerTransport | undefined
```

### `getSseTransport()`

If you started the server with `startSSE()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the SSE communication. Like `getStdioTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getSseTransport(): SSEServerTransport | undefined
```

### `getSseHonoTransport()`

If you started the server with `startHonoSSE()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the SSE communication. Like `getSseTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getSseHonoTransport(): SSETransport | undefined
```

### `getStreamableHTTPTransport()`

If you started the server with `startHTTP()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the HTTP communication. Like `getSseTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getStreamableHTTPTransport(): StreamableHTTPServerTransport | undefined
```

### `tools()`

Executes a specific tool provided by this MCP server.

```typescript
async executeTool(
  toolId: string,
  args: any,
  executionContext?: { messages?: any[]; toolCallId?: string },
): Promise<any>
```

**toolId** (`string`): The ID/name of the tool to execute.

**args** (`any`): The arguments to pass to the tool's execute function.

**executionContext** (`object`): Optional context for the tool execution, like messages or a toolCallId.

## Resource handling

### What are MCP Resources?

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions. They represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available, such as:

- File contents
- Database records
- API responses
- Live system data
- Screenshots and images
- Log files

Resources are identified by unique URIs (e.g., `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`, `postgres://database/customers/schema`) and can contain either text (UTF-8 encoded) or binary data (base64 encoded).

Clients can discover resources through:

1. **Direct resources**: Servers expose a list of concrete resources via a `resources/list` endpoint.
2. **Resource templates**: For runtime-defined resources, servers can expose URI templates (RFC 6570) that clients use to construct resource URIs.

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the URI. Servers can also notify clients about changes to the resource list (`notifications/resources/list_changed`) or updates to specific resource content (`notifications/resources/updated`) if a client has subscribed to that resource.

For more detailed information, refer to the [official MCP documentation on Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources).

### `MCPServerResources` Type

The `resources` option takes an object of type `MCPServerResources`. This type defines the callbacks your server will use to handle resource requests:

```typescript
export type MCPServerResources = {
  // Callback to list available resources
  listResources: () => Promise<Resource[]>

  // Callback to get the content of a specific resource
  getResourceContent: ({
    uri,
  }: {
    uri: string
  }) => Promise<MCPServerResourceContent | MCPServerResourceContent[]>

  // Optional callback to list available resource templates
  resourceTemplates?: () => Promise<ResourceTemplate[]>
}

export type MCPServerResourceContent = { text?: string } | { blob?: string }
```

Example:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import type { MCPServerResourceContent, Resource, ResourceTemplate } from '@mastra/mcp'

// Resources/resource templates will generally be dynamically fetched.
const myResources: Resource[] = [
  { uri: 'file://data/123.txt', name: 'Data File', mimeType: 'text/plain' },
]

const myResourceContents: Record<string, MCPServerResourceContent> = {
  'file://data.txt/123': { text: 'This is the content of the data file.' },
}

const myResourceTemplates: ResourceTemplate[] = [
  {
    uriTemplate: 'file://data/{id}',
    name: 'Data File',
    description: 'A file containing data.',
    mimeType: 'text/plain',
  },
]

const myResourceHandlers: MCPServerResources = {
  listResources: async () => myResources,
  getResourceContent: async ({ uri }) => {
    if (myResourceContents[uri]) {
      return myResourceContents[uri]
    }
    throw new Error(`Resource content not found for ${uri}`)
  },
  resourceTemplates: async () => myResourceTemplates,
}

const serverWithResources = new MCPServer({
  id: 'resourceful-server',
  name: 'Resourceful Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {/* ... your tools ... */},
  resources: myResourceHandlers,
})
```

### Notifying Clients of Resource Changes

If the available resources or their content change, your server can notify connected clients that are subscribed to the specific resource.

#### `server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string })`

Call this method when the content of a specific resource (identified by its `uri`) has been updated. If any clients are subscribed to this URI, they will receive a `notifications/resources/updated` message.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string }): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
// After updating the content of 'file://data.txt'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: 'file://data.txt' })
```

#### `server.resources.notifyListChanged()`

Call this method when the list of available resources has changed (e.g., a resource was added or removed). This will send a `notifications/resources/list_changed` message to clients, prompting them to re-fetch the list of resources.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyListChanged(): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
// After adding a new resource to the list managed by 'myResourceHandlers.listResources'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyListChanged()
```

## Prompt handling

### What are MCP Prompts?

Prompts are reusable templates or workflows that MCP servers expose to clients. They can accept arguments and include resource context. They also support versioning and standardize LLM interactions.

Prompts are identified by a unique name (and optional version) and can be runtime-defined or static.

### `MCPServerPrompts` Type

The `prompts` option takes an object of type `MCPServerPrompts`. This type defines the callbacks your server will use to handle prompt requests:

```typescript
export type MCPServerPrompts = {
  // Callback to list available prompts
  listPrompts: () => Promise<Prompt[]>

  // Callback to get the messages/content for a specific prompt
  getPromptMessages?: ({
    name,
    version,
    args,
  }: {
    name: string
    version?: string
    args?: any
  }) => Promise<{ prompt: Prompt; messages: PromptMessage[] }>
}
```

Example:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import type { Prompt, PromptMessage, MCPServerPrompts } from '@mastra/mcp'

const prompts: Prompt[] = [
  {
    name: 'analyze-code',
    description: 'Analyze code for improvements',
    version: 'v1',
  },
  {
    name: 'analyze-code',
    description: 'Analyze code for improvements (new logic)',
    version: 'v2',
  },
]

const myPromptHandlers: MCPServerPrompts = {
  listPrompts: async () => prompts,
  getPromptMessages: async ({ name, version, args }) => {
    if (name === 'analyze-code') {
      if (version === 'v2') {
        const prompt = prompts.find(p => p.name === name && p.version === 'v2')
        if (!prompt) throw new Error('Prompt version not found')
        return {
          prompt,
          messages: [
            {
              role: 'user',
              content: {
                type: 'text',
                text: `Analyze this code with the new logic: ${args.code}`,
              },
            },
          ],
        }
      }
      // Default or v1
      const prompt = prompts.find(p => p.name === name && p.version === 'v1')
      if (!prompt) throw new Error('Prompt version not found')
      return {
        prompt,
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: { type: 'text', text: `Analyze this code: ${args.code}` },
          },
        ],
      }
    }
    throw new Error('Prompt not found')
  },
}

const serverWithPrompts = new MCPServer({
  id: 'promptful-server',
  name: 'Promptful Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {/* ... */},
  prompts: myPromptHandlers,
})
```

### Notifying Clients of Prompt Changes

If the available prompts change, your server can notify connected clients:

#### `server.prompts.notifyListChanged()`

Call this method when the list of available prompts has changed (e.g., a prompt was added or removed). This will send a `notifications/prompts/list_changed` message to clients, prompting them to re-fetch the list of prompts.

```typescript
await serverWithPrompts.prompts.notifyListChanged()
```

### Best practices for Prompt Handling

- Use clear, descriptive prompt names and descriptions.
- Validate all required arguments in `getPromptMessages`.
- Include a `version` field if you expect to make breaking changes.
- Use the `version` parameter to select the correct prompt logic.
- Notify clients when prompt lists change.
- Handle errors with informative messages.
- Document argument expectations and available versions.

## Dynamic tool management

Tools are usually provided when constructing the `MCPServer`, but you can also add or remove tools while the server is running. The server exposes these operations through the `toolActions` property. When the tool list changes, connected clients receive a `notifications/tools/list_changed` message prompting them to re-fetch the tool list.

The property is `toolActions` because `tools()` is the method that returns the registered tool registry.

### `toolActions.add(tools)`

Registers new tools on the running server and notifies connected clients. Tools are keyed by their record key, the same as tools passed to the constructor. Adding a tool under an existing key replaces it.

```typescript
async server.toolActions.add(tools: ToolsInput): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { z } from 'zod'

const searchTool = createTool({
  id: 'search',
  description: 'Searches the knowledge base.',
  inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ query }) => ({ results: [] }),
})

await server.toolActions.add({ searchTool })
```

### `toolActions.remove(toolIds)`

Removes tools from the running server by tool ID and notifies connected clients. Unknown tool IDs are ignored. A notification is sent only when at least one tool is removed.

```typescript
async server.toolActions.remove(toolIds: string[]): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
await server.toolActions.remove(['searchTool'])
```

### `toolActions.notifyListChanged()`

Sends a `notifications/tools/list_changed` message to connected clients without modifying the tool registry. Call this when tool availability changes through other means (for example, authorization changes).

```typescript
async server.toolActions.notifyListChanged(): Promise<void>
```

### Mastra registry synchronization

When the server is registered with a Mastra instance, `toolActions.add()` and `toolActions.remove()` also update the Mastra instance's tool registry, matching the automatic tool registration that happens at startup. Added tools become available through `mastra.listTools()` (keyed by the tool's intrinsic `id` when present), and removed tools are deleted from the registry.

## Logging

MCP servers can send structured log messages to clients using `notifications/message`. Clients control verbosity by sending a `logging/setLevel` request. The server drops messages below the requested minimum level (following RFC 5424 severity ordering). The level is tracked per session, so different clients can request different verbosity.

### `sendLoggingMessage()`

Sends a log notification to all connected clients, honoring each client's minimum logging level.

```typescript
async server.sendLoggingMessage(params: {
  level: LoggingLevel;
  data: unknown;
  logger?: string;
}): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
await server.sendLoggingMessage({
  level: 'info',
  data: { message: 'Sync completed', itemsProcessed: 42 },
})
```

### `context.mcp.log()`

Inside a tool's `execute` function, use `context.mcp.log()` to send a log message to the client that called the tool.

```typescript
async context.mcp.log(
  level: LoggingLevel,
  message: string,
  data?: Record<string, unknown>
): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
execute: async ({ location }, context) => {
  await context.mcp.log('debug', 'Fetching weather', { location })
  const weather = await fetchWeather(location)
  await context.mcp.log('info', 'Weather fetched')
  return weather
}
```

## Progress notifications

Long-running tools can report progress to the calling client with `notifications/progress`. Progress is only sent when the caller requested progress tracking by including a `progressToken` in the request (the Mastra `MCPClient` does this when `enableProgressTracking` is set). When no token was sent, `context.mcp.progress()` is a no-op.

### `context.mcp.progress()`

```typescript
async context.mcp.progress(params: {
  progress: number;
  total?: number;
  message?: string;
}): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
execute: async ({ items }, context) => {
  for (const [index, item] of items.entries()) {
    await processItem(item)
    await context.mcp.progress({
      progress: index + 1,
      total: items.length,
      message: `Processed ${item.name}`,
    })
  }
  return { done: true }
}
```

## Notification delivery

Notification methods (`resources.notifyListChanged()`, `prompts.notifyListChanged()`, `toolActions.notifyListChanged()`, and `sendLoggingMessage()`) broadcast to every connected client across all transports: the stdio/SSE connection and each streamable HTTP session. `resources.notifyUpdated()` is the exception: it only notifies clients that subscribed to the resource URI via `resources/subscribe`. Subscriptions are tracked per session for streamable HTTP clients; legacy SSE clients share the main server instance and therefore share one subscription set. Clients using the stateless serverless mode can't receive notifications because each request uses a transient server instance.

## Examples

For practical examples of setting up and deploying an MCPServer, see the [Publishing an MCP Server guide](https://mastra.ai/guides/guide/publishing-mcp-server).

The example at the beginning of this page also demonstrates how to instantiate `MCPServer` with both tools and agents.

## Elicitation

### What's Elicitation?

Elicitation is a feature in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows servers to request structured information from users. It supports interactive workflows where servers can collect additional data at runtime.

The `MCPServer` class automatically includes elicitation capabilities. Tools receive a `context.mcp` object in their `execute` function that includes an `elicitation.sendRequest()` method for requesting user input.

### Tool Execution Signature

When tools are executed within an MCP server context, they receive MCP-specific capabilities via the `context.mcp` object:

```typescript
execute: async (inputData, context) => {
  // input contains the tool's inputData parameters
  // context.mcp contains server capabilities like elicitation and authentication info

  // Access authentication information (when available)
  if (context.mcp?.extra?.authInfo) {
    console.log('Authenticated request from:', context.mcp.extra.authInfo.clientId)
  }

  // Use elicitation capabilities
  const result = await context.mcp.elicitation.sendRequest({
    message: 'Please provide information',
    requestedSchema: {/* schema */},
  })

  return result
}
```

### How Elicitation Works

A common use case is during tool execution. When a tool needs user input, it can use the elicitation functionality provided through the context parameter:

1. The tool calls `context.mcp.elicitation.sendRequest()` with a message and schema
2. The request is sent to the connected MCP client
3. The client presents the request to the user (via UI, command line, etc.)
4. The user provides input, declines, or cancels the request
5. The client sends the response back to the server
6. The tool receives the response and continues execution

### Using Elicitation in Tools

Here's an example of a tool that uses elicitation to collect user contact information:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { z } from 'zod'

const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'interactive-server',
  name: 'Interactive Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {
    collectContactInfo: createTool({
      id: 'collectContactInfo',
      description: 'Collects user contact information through elicitation',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        reason: z.string().optional().describe('Reason for collecting contact info'),
      }),
      execute: async (inputData, context) => {
        const { reason } = inputData

        // Log session info if available
        console.log('Request from session:', context.mcp?.extra?.sessionId)

        try {
          // Request user input via elicitation
          const result = await context.mcp.elicitation.sendRequest({
            message: reason
              ? `Please provide your contact information. ${reason}`
              : 'Please provide your contact information',
            requestedSchema: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                name: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Full Name',
                  description: 'Your full name',
                },
                email: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Email Address',
                  description: 'Your email address',
                  format: 'email',
                },
                phone: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Phone Number',
                  description: 'Your phone number (optional)',
                },
              },
              required: ['name', 'email'],
            },
          })

          // Handle the user's response
          if (result.action === 'accept') {
            return `Contact information collected: ${JSON.stringify(result.content, null, 2)}`
          } else if (result.action === 'decline') {
            return 'Contact information collection was declined by the user.'
          } else {
            return 'Contact information collection was cancelled by the user.'
          }
        } catch (error) {
          return `Error collecting contact information: ${error}`
        }
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

### Elicitation Request Schema

The `requestedSchema` must be a flat object with primitive properties only. Supported types include:

- **String**: `{ type: 'string', title: 'Display Name', description: 'Help text' }`
- **Number**: `{ type: 'number', minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }`
- **Boolean**: `{ type: 'boolean', default: false }`
- **Enum**: `{ type: 'string', enum: ['option1', 'option2'] }`

Example schema:

```typescript
{
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Full Name',
      description: 'Your complete name',
    },
    age: {
      type: 'number',
      title: 'Age',
      minimum: 18,
      maximum: 120,
    },
    newsletter: {
      type: 'boolean',
      title: 'Subscribe to Newsletter',
      default: false,
    },
  },
  required: ['name'],
}
```

### Response Actions

Users can respond to elicitation requests in three ways:

1. **Accept** (`action: 'accept'`): User provided data and confirmed submission
   - Contains `content` field with the submitted data
2. **Decline** (`action: 'decline'`): User explicitly declined to provide information
   - No content field
3. **Cancel** (`action: 'cancel'`): User dismissed the request without deciding
   - No content field

Tools should handle all three response types appropriately.

### Security Considerations

- **Never request sensitive information** like passwords, SSNs, or credit card numbers
- Validate all user input against the provided schema
- Handle declining and cancellation gracefully
- Provide clear reasons for data collection
- Respect user privacy and preferences

### Tool Execution API

The elicitation functionality is available through the `options` parameter in tool execution:

```typescript
// Within a tool's execute function
execute: async (inputData, context) => {
  // Use elicitation for user input
  const result = await context.mcp.elicitation.sendRequest({
    message: string,           // Message to display to user
    requestedSchema: object    // JSON schema defining expected response structure
  }): Promise<ElicitResult>

  // Access authentication info if needed
  if (context.mcp?.extra?.authInfo) {
    // Use context.mcp.extra.authInfo.token, etc.
  }
}
```

Elicitation is **session-aware** when using HTTP-based transports (SSE or HTTP). When multiple clients are connected to the same server, elicitation requests are routed to the client session that initiated the tool execution.

The `ElicitResult` type:

```typescript
type ElicitResult = {
  action: 'accept' | 'decline' | 'cancel'
  content?: any // Only present when action is 'accept'
}
```

## OAuth protection

To protect your MCP server with OAuth authentication per the [MCP Auth Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization), use the `createOAuthMiddleware` function:

```typescript
import http from 'node:http'
import { MCPServer, createOAuthMiddleware, createStaticTokenValidator } from '@mastra/mcp'

const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
  id: 'protected-server',
  name: 'Protected MCP Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {/* your tools */},
})

// Create OAuth middleware
const oauthMiddleware = createOAuthMiddleware({
  oauth: {
    resource: 'https://mcp.example.com/mcp',
    authorizationServers: ['https://auth.example.com'],
    scopesSupported: ['mcp:read', 'mcp:write'],
    resourceName: 'My Protected MCP Server',
    validateToken: createStaticTokenValidator(['allowed-token-1']),
  },
  mcpPath: '/mcp',
})

// Create HTTP server with OAuth protection
const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url || '', 'https://mcp.example.com')

  // Apply OAuth middleware first
  const result = await oauthMiddleware(req, res, url)
  if (!result.proceed) return // Middleware handled response (401, metadata, etc.)

  // Token is valid, proceed to MCP handler
  await mcpServer.startHTTP({ url, httpPath: '/mcp', req, res })
})

httpServer.listen(3000)
```

The middleware automatically:

- Serves **Protected Resource Metadata** at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728)
- Returns `401 Unauthorized` with proper `WWW-Authenticate` headers when authentication is required
- Validates bearer tokens using your provided validator

### Token Validation

For production, use proper token validation:

```typescript
import { createOAuthMiddleware, createIntrospectionValidator } from '@mastra/mcp'

// Option 1: Token introspection (RFC 7662)
const middleware = createOAuthMiddleware({
  oauth: {
    resource: 'https://mcp.example.com/mcp',
    authorizationServers: ['https://auth.example.com'],
    validateToken: createIntrospectionValidator('https://auth.example.com/oauth/introspect', {
      clientId: 'mcp-server',
      clientSecret: 'secret',
    }),
  },
})

// Option 2: Custom validation (JWT, database lookup, etc.)
const customMiddleware = createOAuthMiddleware({
  oauth: {
    resource: 'https://mcp.example.com/mcp',
    authorizationServers: ['https://auth.example.com'],
    validateToken: async (token, resource) => {
      const decoded = await verifyJWT(token)
      if (!decoded) {
        return { valid: false, error: 'invalid_token' }
      }
      return {
        valid: true,
        scopes: decoded.scope?.split(' ') || [],
        subject: decoded.sub,
      }
    },
  },
})
```

### OAuth Middleware Options

**oauth.resource** (`string`): The canonical URL of your MCP server. This is returned in Protected Resource Metadata.

**oauth.authorizationServers** (`string[]`): URLs of authorization servers that can issue tokens for this resource.

**oauth.scopesSupported** (`string[]`): Scopes supported by this MCP server. (Default: `['mcp:read', 'mcp:write']`)

**oauth.resourceName** (`string`): Human-readable name for this resource server.

**oauth.validateToken** (`(token: string, resource: string) => Promise<TokenValidationResult>`): Function to validate access tokens. If not provided, tokens are accepted without validation (NOT recommended for production).

**mcpPath** (`string`): Path where the MCP endpoint is served. Only requests to this path require authentication. (Default: `'/mcp'`)

## Authentication context

Tools can access request metadata via `context.mcp.extra` when using HTTP-based transports. This allows you to pass authentication info, user context, or any custom data from your HTTP middleware to your MCP tools.

### How it works

Whatever you set on `req.auth` in your HTTP middleware becomes available as `context.mcp.extra.authInfo` in your tools:

```text
req.auth = { ... }  →  context?.mcp?.extra?.authInfo.extra = { ... }
```

### Map auth data for FGA

When an `MCPServer` is registered on a Mastra instance with a fine-grained authorization (FGA) provider, Mastra checks `requestContext.get('user')` before listing or calling tools. HTTP MCP transports pass authenticated data as `extra.authInfo`, so use `mapAuthInfoToUser` to set the user shape expected by your FGA provider.

```typescript
const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'my-server',
  name: 'My Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: { getUserData },
  mapAuthInfoToUser: ({ authInfo }) => {
    const user = authInfo as {
      extra?: {
        userId?: string
        organizationMembershipId?: string
      }
    }

    if (!user.extra?.userId) {
      return null
    }

    return {
      id: user.extra.userId,
      organizationMembershipId: user.extra.organizationMembershipId,
    }
  },
})
```

### Scope MCP tool FGA separately

Use `fga.resourceMapping` and `fga.permissionMapping` when MCP clients need a different authorization scope than internal agent or workflow tool execution. The override applies only to `tools/list` and `tools/call` checks for this MCP server.

```typescript
import { MastraFGAPermissions } from '@mastra/core/auth/ee'

const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'my-server',
  name: 'My Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: { getUserData },
  mapAuthInfoToUser: ({ authInfo }) => {
    const user = authInfo as {
      extra?: {
        userId?: string
        organizationMembershipId?: string
      }
    }

    if (!user.extra?.userId) {
      return null
    }

    return {
      id: user.extra.userId,
      organizationMembershipId: user.extra.organizationMembershipId,
    }
  },
  fga: {
    resourceMapping: {
      tool: {
        fgaResourceType: 'user',
        deriveId: ({ user }) => (user as { id: string }).id,
      },
    },
    permissionMapping: {
      [MastraFGAPermissions.TOOLS_EXECUTE]: 'read',
    },
  },
})
```

### Setting Up Authentication Middleware

To pass data to your tools, populate `req.auth` on the Node.js request object in your HTTP server middleware before calling `server.startHTTP()`.

```typescript
import express from 'express'

type MCPAuthenticatedRequest = express.Request & {
  auth?: {
    token: string
    clientId: string
    scopes: string[]
    expiresAt?: number
    extra?: Record<string, unknown>
  }
}

const app = express()

// Auth middleware - set req.auth before the MCP handler
app.use('/mcp', async (req, res, next) => {
  const authorization = req.headers.authorization

  if (!authorization?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Missing bearer token' })
    return
  }

  const token = authorization.slice('Bearer '.length)

  try {
    const user = await verifyToken(token)

    // This entire object becomes context.mcp.extra.authInfo
    const authenticatedRequest = req as MCPAuthenticatedRequest
    authenticatedRequest.auth = {
      token,
      clientId: user.clientId,
      scopes: user.scopes,
      expiresAt: user.expiresAt,
      extra: {
        userId: user.userId,
        email: user.email,
      },
    }
    next()
  } catch {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid or expired token' })
  }
})

app.all('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`)
  await server.startHTTP({ url, httpPath: '/mcp', req, res })
})
```

### Accessing Auth Data in Tools

The `req.auth` object is available as `context.mcp.extra.authInfo` in your tool's execute function:

```typescript
execute: async (inputData, context) => {
  // Access the auth data you set in middleware
  const authInfo = context?.mcp?.extra?.authInfo

  if (!authInfo?.extra?.userId) {
    return { error: 'Authentication required' }
  }

  // Use the auth data
  console.log('User ID:', authInfo.extra.userId)
  console.log('Email:', authInfo.extra.email)

  const response = await fetch('/api/data', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authInfo.token}` },
    signal: context?.mcp?.extra?.signal,
  })

  return response.json()
}
```

### Passing `RequestContext` through to agent

```typescript
execute: async (inputData, context) => {
  // Access the auth data you set in middleware
  const authInfo = context?.mcp?.extra?.authInfo

  const requestContext = context.requestContext || new RequestContext().set('someKey', authInfo)

  if (!authInfo?.extra?.userId) {
    return { error: 'Authentication required' }
  }

  // Use the auth data
  console.log('User ID:', authInfo.extra.userId)
  console.log('Email:', authInfo.extra.email)

  const agent = context?.mastra?.getAgentById('some-agent-id')

  if (!agent) {
    return { error: "Agent 'some-agent-id' not found" }
  }

  const response = await agent.generate(prompt, { requestContext })

  return response.text
}
```

### The `extra` Object

The full `context.mcp.extra` object contains:

| Property           | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `authInfo`         | Whatever you set on `req.auth` in your middleware |
| `sessionId`        | Session identifier for the MCP connection         |
| `signal`           | AbortSignal for request cancellation              |
| `sendNotification` | MCP protocol function for sending notifications   |
| `sendRequest`      | MCP protocol function for sending requests        |

### Complete Example

Install [`jose`](https://github.com/panva/jose) to verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) against your identity provider's JSON Web Key Set (JWKS):

**npm**:

```shell
npm install jose
```

**pnpm**:

```shell
pnpm add jose
```

**Yarn**:

```shell
yarn add jose
```

**Bun**:

```shell
bun add jose
```

The following example validates the token's signature, issuer, audience, algorithm, expiration, and required claims before passing its user data to the tool:

```typescript
import express from 'express'
import { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } from 'jose'
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { z } from 'zod'

type MCPAuthenticatedRequest = express.Request & {
  auth?: {
    token: string
    clientId: string
    scopes: string[]
    expiresAt?: number
    extra?: Record<string, unknown>
  }
}

const issuer = process.env.JWT_ISSUER
const audience = process.env.JWT_AUDIENCE
const jwksUri = process.env.JWT_JWKS_URI

if (!issuer || !audience || !jwksUri) {
  throw new Error('JWT_ISSUER, JWT_AUDIENCE, and JWT_JWKS_URI are required')
}

const jwks = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(jwksUri))

const verifyToken = async (token: string) => {
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, jwks, {
    issuer,
    audience,
    algorithms: ['RS256'],
    requiredClaims: ['exp'],
  })

## MCP Apps (`appResources`)

The `appResources` option lets you serve interactive HTML UIs from your MCP server via the [MCP Apps extension](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps). Each entry maps a `ui://` URI to an HTML app that renders in a sandboxed iframe in Mastra Studio.

### `AppResources` type

**Key (URI)** (`string`): A ui:// URI that identifies the app resource (e.g., ui://calculator/main).

Each value is an `AppResource` object:

**name** (`string`): Display name for the UI resource.

**description** (`string`): Optional description of the UI resource.

**html** (`string`): Inline HTML content for the UI. Provide either html or htmlPath.

**htmlPath** (`string`): Path to an HTML file. Resolved at server startup. Provide either html or htmlPath.

**meta** (`McpUiResourceMeta`): UI resource metadata (CSP, permissions, rendering preferences) from the official ext-apps SDK.

### Example

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from '@mastra/mcp'
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools'
import { z } from 'zod'

const calculatorTool = createTool({
  id: 'calculatorWithUI',
  description: 'An interactive calculator',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    num1: z.number(),
    num2: z.number(),
    operation: z.enum(['add', 'subtract']),
  }),
  execute: async ({ num1, num2, operation }) => {
    const result = operation === 'add' ? num1 + num2 : num1 - num2
    return {
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'An interactive calculator is displayed.' }],
      structuredContent: { result },
    }
  },
})

const server = new MCPServer({
  id: 'app-server',
  name: 'App Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: { calculatorTool },
  appResources: {
    'ui://calculator/main': {
      name: 'Interactive Calculator',
      html: '<html><body><h2>Calculator</h2>...</body></html>',
    },
  },
})
```

Link a tool to its app resource by setting `_meta.ui.resourceUri` on the tool to the matching `ui://` URI. The server auto-normalizes this metadata when registering tools. Visit [MCP Apps](https://mastra.ai/docs/mcp/overview) for the full app bridge API and usage patterns.
