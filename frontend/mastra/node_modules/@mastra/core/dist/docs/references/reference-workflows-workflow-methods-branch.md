# Workflow\.branch()

The `.branch()` method creates conditional branches between workflow steps, allowing for different paths to be taken based on the result of a previous step.

## Usage example

```typescript
workflow.branch([
  [async ({ context }) => true, step1],
  [async ({ context }) => false, step2],
])
```

## Parameters

**steps** (`[() => boolean, Step]`): An array of tuples, each containing a condition function and a step to execute if the condition is true

## Returns

**workflow** (`NewWorkflow`): The workflow instance for method chaining
